C. ABBOTT.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPREFACE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no one of the Pioneers of this continent whose achievements\\r\\nequal those of the Chevalier Robert de la Salle. He passed over\\r\\nthousands of miles of lakes and rivers in the birch canoe. He traversed\\r\\ncountless leagues of prairie and forest, on foot, guided by the\\r\\nmoccasined Indian, threading trails which the white man\\'s foot had\\r\\nnever trod, and penetrating the villages and the wigwams of savages,\\r\\nwhere the white man\\'s face had never been seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nFear was an emotion La Salle never experienced. His adventures were\\r\\nmore wild and wondrous than almost any recorded in the tales of\\r\\nchivalry. As time is rapidly obliterating from our land the footprints\\r\\nof the savage, it is important that these records of his strange\\r\\nexistence should be perpetuated.\\r\\n\\r\\nFortunately we have full and accurate accounts of these explorations,\\r\\nin the journals of Messrs. Marquette, Hennepin, and Joliet. We have\\r\\nstill more minute narratives, in _Etablissement de la Foix_, par le P.\\r\\nChretien Le Clercq, Paris 1691; _Dernieres DÃ¨couvertes_, par le\\r\\nChevalier de Tonti, Paris 1697; _Journal Historique_, par M. Joutel,\\r\\nParis 1713.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the incidents in the last fatal expedition, to establish a colony\\r\\nat the mouth of the Mississippi, and the wonderful land tour of more\\r\\nthan two thousand miles from the sea-coast of Texas to Quebec, through\\r\\nthe territories of hundreds of tribes, we have the narratives of Father\\r\\nChristian Le Clercq, the narrative of Father Anastasias Douay, and the\\r\\nminute and admirably written almost daily journal of Monsieur Joutel,\\r\\nin his _Dernier Voyage_. Both Douay and Joutel accompanied this\\r\\nexpedition from its commencement to its close.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn these adventures the reader will find a more vivid description of\\r\\nthe condition of this continent, and the character of its inhabitants\\r\\ntwo hundred years ago, than can be found anywhere else. Sir Walter\\r\\nScott once remarked, that no one could take more pleasure in reading\\r\\nhis romances, than he had taken in writing them. In this volume we have\\r\\nthe romance of truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the writer can judge of the pleasure of the reader, from the intense\\r\\ninterest he has experienced in following these adventurers through\\r\\ntheir perilous achievements, this narrative will prove to be one of\\r\\nextraordinary interest.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                            JOHN S.

Scenes Sublime\\r\\nand Beautiful. Adventures in an Indian Village.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly three hundred and forty years ago, in April 1541, De Soto, in\\r\\nhis adventurous march, discovered the majestic Mississippi, not far\\r\\nfrom the border of the State of Tennessee. No white man\\'s eye had ever\\r\\nbefore beheld that flood whose banks are now inhabited by busy\\r\\nmillions. The Indians informed him that all the region below consisted\\r\\nof dismal, endless, uninhabitable swamps. De Soto, world-weary and\\r\\nwoe-stricken, died upon the banks of the river. In its fathomless\\r\\ndepths his body found burial.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese cruel adventurers, insanely impelled in search of mines of gold,\\r\\nfounded no settlements, and left behind them no traces of their\\r\\npassage, save that by their cruelties they had excited the implacable\\r\\nire of the Indian against the white man. A hundred years of earth\\'s\\r\\nmany griefs lingered slowly away, while these vast solitudes were\\r\\npeopled only by wandering savage tribes whose record must forever\\r\\nremain unknown.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the year 1641, some French envoys, from Canada, seeking to open\\r\\nfriendly trade with the Indians for the purchase of furs, penetrated\\r\\nthe northwest of our country as far as the Falls of St. Mary, near the\\r\\noutlet of Lake Superior. The most friendly relations existed between\\r\\nthese Frenchmen and the Indians, wherever the tribes were encountered.\\r\\nThis visit led to no settlement. The adventurous traders purchased many\\r\\nfurs, with which they loaded their birch canoes: established friendly\\r\\nrelations with these distant Indians, and greatly extended the region\\r\\nfrom which furs were brought to their trading posts in Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nEighteen more years passed away, over the silent and gloomy wilderness,\\r\\nwhen in 1659, a little band of these bold and hardy explorers, in their\\r\\nfrail canoes, with Indian guides, paddled along the lonely,\\r\\nforest-fringed shores of Lake Ontario, ascended the Niagara River to\\r\\nthe Falls, carried their canoes on their shoulders around the rapids,\\r\\nlaunched them again on Lake Erie, traversed that inland sea over two\\r\\nhundred and fifty miles, entered the magnificent Strait, passed through\\r\\nit to Lake St. Clair, crossed that lake, ascended the St. Clair River\\r\\nto Lake Huron, and traversing its whole length, a distance of three\\r\\nhundred miles, reached the Falls of St. Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, at the distance of more than a thousand miles from the least\\r\\nvestiges of civilization, and surrounded by numerous and powerful bands\\r\\nof savages, these hardy men passed an inclement winter. Amidst rocks\\r\\nand gloomy pines they reared their hut. Game was abundant, fuel was at\\r\\ntheir door, the Indians were hospitable, and they wanted for nothing.\\r\\nOne event only darkened these wintry months. The leader of the band\\r\\nbecame lost in the woods and perished.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the spring the men returned rejoicingly to Canada, with their canoes\\r\\nladen with the richest furs. They also brought such reports of the\\r\\ndocility and amiability of the Indians, as to inspire the Christians in\\r\\nCanada with the intense desire to establish missionary stations among\\r\\nthem. Five years passed away, when Father Claude Allouez, with a small\\r\\nband of Christian heroes, penetrated these wilds to proclaim the glad\\r\\ntidings of the Gospel. Two years after, he was followed by Father James\\r\\nMarquette, a noble man, whose name will never die.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the explorations of Marquette opened the way for the still more\\r\\nwonderful excursions of La Salle, I must here introduce a brief account\\r\\nof his adventures. There is something in blood. The Marquette family\\r\\nhad been illustrious in France from time immemorial. Generation after\\r\\ngeneration, many of its members had obtained renown, not only for\\r\\nchivalric courage, but for every virtue which can adorn humanity. Their\\r\\nancestral home was a massive feudal castle on an eminence near the\\r\\nstately city of Leon. The armorial bearing of the family commemorates\\r\\ndeeds of heroic enterprise five hundred years ago. They were generally\\r\\nearnest Christians.\\r\\n\\r\\nJames Marquette was born at the ancient seat of the family in the year\\r\\n1637. His mother was a woman of fervent piety and of unusual strength\\r\\nand culture of mind. Her brother, John Baptiste de la Salle, was the\\r\\nfounder of a system of Christian schools for the gratuitous education\\r\\nof the poor. Thousands were thus instructed long before the present\\r\\nsystem of public schools was introduced. It was to the instructions of\\r\\nhis noble mother that James Marquette was indebted for his elevated\\r\\nChristian character, and for his self-sacrificing devotion to the\\r\\ninterests of humanity, which have given his name celebrity through a\\r\\nlarge portion of the Christian world.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the age of seventeen this noble young man, resisting all the\\r\\nbrilliant allurements the world opened to one of his wealth and rank,\\r\\nconsecrated himself to the service of religion by entering the ministry\\r\\nin the Catholic Church, in which he was born and educated, and by whose\\r\\ninfluences he was exclusively surrounded.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo years were devoted to intense study. Then, for twelve years, he was\\r\\nemployed in teaching and in many laborious and self-denying duties. As\\r\\nwas natural, with a young man of his ardent nature and glowing spirit\\r\\nof enterprise, he was very desirous of conveying the glad tidings of\\r\\nthe Gospel to those distant nations who had never even heard of the\\r\\nname of Jesus.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada and its savage tribes were then attracting much attention in\\r\\nFrance. Wonderful stories were told of the St. Lawrence River, and of\\r\\nthe series of majestic lakes, spreading far away into the unknown\\r\\ninterior, and whose shores were crowded with Indian tribes of strange\\r\\naspect, language, and customs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the year 1666, Marquette set sail from France, On the 20th of\\r\\nSeptember, he landed, on the banks of the St. Lawrence, at a little\\r\\nhamlet of French log-cabins and Indian wigwams, called Quebec. He was\\r\\nthen but twenty-nine years of age. There was, at that time, another\\r\\nmissionary, M. Allouez, on an exploring tour far away upon the majestic\\r\\nlakes of the interior. With adventurous footsteps he was traversing\\r\\nprairie solitudes and forest glooms, upon which no eye of civilized man\\r\\nhad ever yet looked. His birch canoe, paddled by Indian guides, glided\\r\\nover solitary waters hundreds of leagues beyond the remotest frontier\\r\\nstations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was quite an important trading-post at the mouth of Saguenay\\r\\nRiver. This was a remarkable stream, which entered the St. Lawrence\\r\\nabout one hundred and twenty miles below Quebec. It came rushing down,\\r\\nfrom unknown regions of the north, with very rapid flood, entering the\\r\\nSt. Lawrence at a point where that majestic river was eleven miles in\\r\\nwidth.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the French government had established one of the most important\\r\\ncommercial and religious stations of that day. At certain seasons of\\r\\nthe year it presented an extraordinary wild and picturesque aspect of\\r\\nbusy life. There were countless Indian tribes, clustered in villages\\r\\nalong the banks of the St. Lawrence, the Saguenay, and their tributary\\r\\nstreams. In the early summer, the Indians came by hundreds, in fleets\\r\\nof canoes--men, women and children--to this great mart of traffic. They\\r\\ncame in their gayest attire, reared their wigwams on the plain, kindled\\r\\ntheir fires, and engaged in all the barbaric sports of Indian gala\\r\\ndays. The scene presented was so full of life and beauty, that the most\\r\\nskilful artist might despair of his ability to transfer it to the\\r\\ncanvas.\\r\\n\\r\\nFather Marquette took his station at this point. Here for twelve years\\r\\nhe patiently labored, trying to teach the Indians the way of salvation\\r\\nthrough faith in Jesus Christ. Full of enthusiasm, and naturally\\r\\nendowed with a very enterprising spirit, his heart glowed with zeal as\\r\\nhe listened to the narrative of Father Allouez, of populous tribes, far\\r\\naway on the majestic shores of Huron, Michigan, Superior. These tribes\\r\\nhad never heard of the mission of the Son of God, to save a lost world.\\r\\nThey had but very faint conceptions of the Heavenly Father. Marquette\\r\\ncould not resist the impulse to carry the Gospel to these realms of\\r\\ndarkness.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is difficult for us now to form any adequate conception of the\\r\\nlittle hamlet, at the mouth of the Saguenay, where Marquette commenced\\r\\nhis missionary labors. The log-cabins of the French, their store-house,\\r\\nand, most prominent of all, the cross-surmounted log chapel, were\\r\\nclustered together. At a little distance, on the plain, were hundreds\\r\\nof Indian wigwams. Bark canoes, light as bubbles, were seen gliding\\r\\nover the still waters, which were there expanded into a beautiful bay.\\r\\nThe glooms of the gigantic forest, spreading back to unexplored and\\r\\nunimagined depth, added to the sublimity of the scene.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere seemed to be no apprehension of hostility on either side. The\\r\\nintercourse between the two parties of civilized and uncivilized men\\r\\nwas truly fraternal. The French conformed, as far as possible, to the\\r\\nmodes of life of the Indians. They shared in their games, married the\\r\\ndaughters of their chiefs, and in all points endeavored to identify the\\r\\ninterests of the natives with their own.\\r\\n\\r\\nM. Marquette had a remarkable facility in the acquisition of languages.\\r\\nThere was a general resemblance in the language of all the tribes on\\r\\nthe St. Lawrence. He could very soon speak fluently with all. Taking\\r\\nIndian guides with him, he commenced tours in various directions,\\r\\npaddled by Indians in the birch bark canoe. He visited tribe after\\r\\ntribe, met the chiefs at their council fires, slept in the wigwams,\\r\\nadministered medicines to the sick, and, with zeal which no\\r\\ndiscouragement could chill, endeavored to point the living and the\\r\\ndying to that Saviour who taketh away the sins of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter spending two years in these labors, he obtained an appointment to\\r\\nconnect himself with a mission established nearly a thousand miles\\r\\nwest, far away upon the shores of Lake Superior. On the 21st of April,\\r\\n1668, he left Quebec for Montreal. The distance was one hundred and\\r\\neighty miles up the river. The voyage was made in a birch canoe, with\\r\\nthree boatmen to aid him in paddling it against the stream. They could\\r\\nproceed about thirty miles a day. The voyage occupied about a week.\\r\\nThere were Indian villages on the banks where they occasionally slept.\\r\\nAt other times they encamped in the forest, the night wind lulling them\\r\\nto sleep, as it sighed through the leafless branches, which the\\r\\nreturning sun of spring had scarcely yet caused to bud.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Montreal there was a little cluster of cabins and wigwams,\\r\\npresenting a very different aspect from the stately city which now\\r\\nadorns that site. After a short tarry there, waiting for a suitable\\r\\nguide, to traverse more than a thousand miles of almost pathless\\r\\nwilderness, a party of Nez-PercÃ© Indians, from Lake Superior, came down\\r\\nthe river in their canoes. With them Marquette embarked. It was a\\r\\nwonderful voyage which this gentleman, from the refinement and culture\\r\\nof France, made alone with these savages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey paddled up the Ottawa River a distance of nearly four hundred\\r\\nmiles. Thence through a series of narrow streams and minor lakes, they\\r\\nentered Lake Nipissing. Descending the rapid flood of French River,\\r\\nthrough cheerless solitudes eighty miles in extent, they entered\\r\\nGeorgian Bay. Crossing this vast sheet of water over an expanse of\\r\\nfifty miles, they saw the apparently boundless waves of Lake Huron\\r\\nopening before them. The northern shores of this inland sea they\\r\\nskirted, until they reached the river St. Mary, which connects Lake\\r\\nSuperior with Lake Huron. Here two missionary stations were\\r\\nestablished.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne was near the entrance of the river into Lake Huron, about forty\\r\\nmiles below the celebrated Falls of St. Mary. The other was at Green\\r\\nBay, an immense lake in itself, jutting out from the northwestern\\r\\nextremity of Lake Michigan. Father Marquette reared his log-cabin in\\r\\nthe vicinity of a small Indian village, on the main land, just south of\\r\\nthe island of Mackinaw. He named the station St. Ignatius. In this vast\\r\\nsolitude this heroic man commenced his labors of love. There were about\\r\\ntwo thousand souls in the tribes immediately around him. With great\\r\\ndocility they listened to his teachings, and were eager to be baptized\\r\\nas Christians. But the judicious father was in no haste thus to secure\\r\\nmerely their nominal conversion. The dying, upon professions of\\r\\npenitence, he was ever ready to baptize, and to administer to them the\\r\\nsacrament of the Lord\\'s Supper. With the rest he labored to root out\\r\\nall the remnants of their degrading superstitions, and to give them\\r\\ncorrect ideas of salvation through repentance, amendment, and trust in\\r\\nan atoning Saviour.\\r\\n\\r\\nGradually Marquette gathered around him a little band of loving\\r\\ndisciples. For three years he labored with them cheerfully, joyously.\\r\\nHis gentle and devoted spirit won, not merely the friendship of the\\r\\nIndians, but their ardent affections. He was just as safe among them as\\r\\nthe most beloved father surrounded by his children. Three years this\\r\\ngood man remained in these lonely wilds, peacefully and successfully\\r\\nteaching these benighted children of the forest. During all this time\\r\\nhis mind had been much exercised with the thought of exploring the\\r\\nlimitless and unknown regions south and west.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had heard rumors of the Mississippi, the Father of Waters; and his\\r\\ndevout mind peopled the vast realms through which it flowed with the\\r\\nlost children of God, whom he perhaps might reclaim, through the Gospel\\r\\nof Jesus, who had come from heaven for their redemption. The Governor\\r\\nof Canada was desirous, for more worldly reasons, of exploring these\\r\\nregions, where future empires might be reared.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven the Indians knew but little respecting this great and distant\\r\\nriver. There was much uncertainty whether it ran south, into the Gulf\\r\\nof Mexico, or west, emptying into the Gulf of California, which Spanish\\r\\nexplorers had called the Red Sea, in consequence of its resemblance to\\r\\nthat Asiatic sheet of water, or whether it turned easterly, entering\\r\\nthe Atlantic Ocean somewhere near the Virginia coast.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the spring of the year 1673, Governor Frontenac sent a French\\r\\ngentleman, M. Joliet, from Quebec, with five boatmen, to Point St.\\r\\nIgnatius, to take Father Marquette on board and set out to find and\\r\\nexplore the downward course of this much talked of river. M. Joliet was\\r\\nadmirably qualified for this responsible enterprise. He was a man of\\r\\ndeep religious convictions, had spent several years among the Indians,\\r\\nwas a very courteous man in all his intercourse with them, was\\r\\nthoroughly acquainted with their customs, and spoke several of their\\r\\nlanguages. As to courage, it was said that he absolutely feared\\r\\nnothing. The good father writes, in reference to his own appointment to\\r\\nthis expedition:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"I was the more enraptured at this good news, as I saw my designs\\r\\n    on the point of being accomplished, and myself in the happy\\r\\n    necessity of exposing my life for the salvation of all these\\r\\n    nations. Our joy at being chosen for this enterprise, sweetened the\\r\\n    labor of paddling from morning till night. As we were going to seek\\r\\n    unknown countries, we took all possible precautions, that if our\\r\\n    enterprise were hazardous, it should not be foolhardy. For this\\r\\n    reason we gathered all possible information from the Indians, who\\r\\n    had frequented those parts. We even traced a map of all the new\\r\\n    country, marking down the rivers on which we were to sail, the\\r\\n    names of the nations through which we were to pass, and the course\\r\\n    of the great river.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 13th of May, 1673, this little band, consisting of M. Joliet,\\r\\nFather Marquette, and five boatmen, in two birch canoes, commenced\\r\\ntheir adventurous voyage. They took with them some Indian corn and\\r\\njerked meat; but they were to live mainly upon such food as they could\\r\\nobtain by the way. The immense sheet of water, at the northwestern\\r\\nextremity of Lake Michigan, called Green Bay, is one hundred miles long\\r\\nby twenty or thirty broad. The boatmen paddled their frail canoes along\\r\\nthe western border of this lake until they reached its southern\\r\\nextremity, where they found a shallow river, flowing into it from the\\r\\nsouth, which they called Fox River. They could propel their canoes\\r\\nabout thirty miles a day. Each night they selected some propitious spot\\r\\nfor their encampment. Upon some dry and grassy mound they could\\r\\nspeedily, with their axes, construct a hut which would protect them\\r\\nfrom the weather. Carefully smoothing down the floor, they spread over\\r\\nit their ample couch of furs. Fish could be taken in abundance. The\\r\\nforest was filled with game. An immense fire, blazing before the open\\r\\nside of the hut, gave warmth, and illumined the sublime scene with\\r\\nalmost the brilliance of noon-day. There they joyously cooked their\\r\\nsuppers, with appetites which rendered the feast more luxurious to them\\r\\nprobably than any gourmand at Delmonico\\'s ever enjoyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach night Father Marquette held a religious service, which all\\r\\nreverently attended. Prayers were offered, and their hymns of Christian\\r\\ndevotion floated sweetly through those sublime solitudes. The boatmen\\r\\nwere men of a gentle race, who had been taught from infancy to revere\\r\\nthe exercises of the church.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey came upon several Indian villages. But the natives were as\\r\\nfriendly as brothers. Many of them had visited the station at St.\\r\\nIgnatius, and all of them had heard of Father Marquette and his labors\\r\\nof love. These children of the forest begged their revered friend to\\r\\ndesist from his enterprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are,\" they said, \"on the _great river_, bad Indians who will cut\\r\\noff your heads without any cause. There are fierce warriors who will\\r\\ntry to seize you and make you slaves. There are enormous birds there,\\r\\nwhose wings darken the air, and who can swallow you all, with your\\r\\ncanoes, at a mouthful. And worst of all, there is a malignant demon\\r\\nthere who, if you escape all other dangers, will cause the waters to\\r\\nboil and whirl around you and devour you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo all this, the good Marquette replied, \"I thank you, dear friends,\\r\\nfor your kind advice, but I cannot follow it. There are souls there, to\\r\\nsave whom, the Son of God came to earth and died. Their salvation is at\\r\\nstake. I would joyfully lay down my life if I could guide them to the\\r\\nSaviour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey found the navigation of Fox River impeded with many rapids. To\\r\\nsurmount these it was necessary often to alight from their canoes, and,\\r\\nwading over the rough and sharp stones, to drag them up against the\\r\\nswift current. They were within the limits of the present State of\\r\\nWisconsin, and found themselves in a region of lakes, sluggish streams,\\r\\nand marshes. But there were Indian trails, which had been trodden for\\r\\nuncounted generations, leading west. These they followed, often\\r\\npainfully carrying their canoes and their burdens on their shoulders,\\r\\nfor many miles, from water to water, over what the Indians called the\\r\\n_Carrying Places_.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length they entered a region of remarkable luxuriance, fertility,\\r\\nand beauty. There were crystal streams and charming lakes. Magnificent\\r\\nforests were interspersed with broad and green prairies. God seemed to\\r\\nhave formed, in these remote realms, an Eden of surpassing loveliness\\r\\nfor the abode of his children. Three tribes, in perfect harmony,\\r\\noccupied the region--the Miamis, Mascoutins, and Kickapoos. There was a\\r\\nlarge village with abundant corn-fields around. River and lake, forest\\r\\nand prairie were alike alive with game.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo their surprise they found that the French missionary, Father\\r\\nAllouez, had reached this distant spot, preaching the Gospel, eight\\r\\nyears before. The Indians had received him with fraternal kindness. He\\r\\nhad left in the centre of the village a cross, the emblem of the\\r\\ncrucified Son of God.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I found,\" Marquette writes, \"that these good people had hung skins and\\r\\nbelts and bows and arrows on the cross, an offering to the Great\\r\\nSpirit, to thank him because he had taken pity on them during the\\r\\nwinter and had given them an abundant chase.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNo white man had ever penetrated beyond this region. These simple,\\r\\ninoffensive people seemed greatly surprised that seven unarmed men\\r\\nshould venture to press on to meet the unknown dangers of the\\r\\nwilderness beyond--wilds which their imaginations had peopled with all\\r\\nconceivable terrors.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 10th of June these heroic men resumed their journey. The kind\\r\\nIndians furnished them with two guides to lead them through the\\r\\nintricacies of the forest to a river, about ten miles distant, which\\r\\nthey called Wisconsin, and which they said flowed westward into the\\r\\nFather of Waters. They soon reached this stream. The Indians helped\\r\\nthem to carry their canoes and effects across the portage. \"We were\\r\\nthen left,\" writes Marquette, \"alone in that unknown country, in the\\r\\nhand of God.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOur voyagers found the stream hard to navigate. It was full of\\r\\nsand-bars and shallows. There were many islands covered with the\\r\\nrichest verdure. At times they came upon landscapes of enchanting\\r\\nbeauty, with lawns and parks and lakes, as if arranged by the most\\r\\ncareful hands of art.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter descending this stream about one hundred and twenty miles, they\\r\\nreached the mouth of the Wisconsin River, and saw the flood of the\\r\\nMississippi rolling majestically before them. It was the 17th of June\\r\\n1673, Father Marquette writes that, upon beholding the river, he\\r\\nexperienced a joy which he could not express.\\r\\n\\r\\nEasily they could be swept down by the rapid current into the sublime\\r\\nunexplored solitudes below. But to paddle back against the\\r\\nswift-rolling tide would try the muscles of the hardiest men. Still the\\r\\nvoyagers pressed on. It was indeed a fairy scene which now opened\\r\\nbefore them. Here bold bluffs hundreds of feet high, jutted into the\\r\\nriver. Here were crags of stupendous size and of every variety of form,\\r\\noften reminding one of Europe\\'s most picturesque stream, where\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"The castled crags of Drachenfels,\\r\\n    Frown o\\'er the wide and winding Rhine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain the prairie would spread out its ocean-like expanse, embellished\\r\\nwith groves, garlanded with flowers of gorgeous colors waving in the\\r\\nsummer breeze, checkered with sunshine and the shade of passing clouds,\\r\\nwith roving herds of the stately buffalo and the graceful antelope. And\\r\\nagain the gloomy forest would appear, extending over countless leagues,\\r\\nwhere bears, wolves, and panthers found a congenial home.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving descended the river nearly two hundred miles they came to an\\r\\nIndian trail, leading back into the country. It was so well trodden as\\r\\nto give evidence that a powerful tribe was near. It speaks well for the\\r\\nIndians--for the reputation which they then enjoyed--that Marquette,\\r\\nwith his French companion, M. Joliet, far away in the wilderness, seven\\r\\nhundred miles from any spot which a white man\\'s foot had ever before\\r\\ntrod, should not have hesitated alone to enter this trail in search of\\r\\nthe habitations of this unknown tribe. They left all their companions,\\r\\nwith the canoes, on the bank of the river.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We cautioned them,\" writes Father Marquette, \"strictly to beware of a\\r\\nsurprise. Then M. Joliet and I undertook this rather hazardous\\r\\ndiscovery, for two single men, who thus put themselves at the\\r\\ndiscretion of an unknown and barbarous people.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese two bold adventurers followed the trail in silence for about six\\r\\nmiles. They then saw, not far from them, upon a meadow on the banks of\\r\\na small stream, a very picturesque group of wigwams, with all the\\r\\naccompaniments of loafing warriors, busy women, sporting children, and\\r\\nwolfish dogs, usually to be found in an Indian village. At the distance\\r\\nof about a mile and a half, upon a gentle eminence, there was another\\r\\nvillage of about equal size.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Indians had not yet caught sight of them, they fell upon their\\r\\nknees, and Father Marquette, in fervent prayer, commended themselves to\\r\\nGod. They then gave a loud shout, to attract the attention of the\\r\\nIndians, and stepped out into open view. The whole community was\\r\\ninstantly thrown into commotion, rushing from the wigwams, and\\r\\ngathering in apparently an anxious group.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a brief conference they seemed to come to the conclusion that two\\r\\nunarmed men could not thus approach them, announcing their coming, with\\r\\nany hostile intent. Four of their aged men were deputed to go forward\\r\\nand greet the strangers. They advanced with much dignity, not uttering\\r\\na word, but waving, in their hands, the pipes of peace. As it\\r\\nafterwards appeared, they had often heard of the arrival of the French\\r\\nin Canada, of the wonderful articles which they brought for traffic,\\r\\nand of the missionaries, with their long black gowns. The name of\\r\\nBlackgowns was the one with which, in all the tribes, they designated\\r\\nthese preachers of the Gospel. When they had come within a few paces of\\r\\nthe strangers, they regarded them attentively and waited to be\\r\\naddressed. Both M. Joliet and Father Marquette understood that these\\r\\nceremonies indicated friendship. Father Marquette broke the silence by\\r\\ninquiring\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To what nation do you belong?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are Illinois,\" one of them replied, \"and in token of peace we have\\r\\nbrought you our pipes to smoke. We invite you to our village, where all\\r\\nare awaiting you with impatience.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Frenchman and the four Indians walked together to the village. At\\r\\nthe door of one of the largest wigwams, one of the ancients stood to\\r\\nreceive them. According to their custom, on such occasions, he was\\r\\nentirely unclothed. This probably was the savage mode of indicating\\r\\nthat there were no concealed weapons about the person. This man, with\\r\\nhis hands raised toward the sun, which was shining brightly, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How beautiful is the sun, O Frenchmen! when you come to visit us. All\\r\\nour people welcome you, and you shall enter all our cabins in peace.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then led them into the wigwam. A large concourse remained outside in\\r\\nrespectful silence. Only the principal men entered the wigwam. Mats\\r\\nwere provided, for the guests, in the centre. The rest took seats\\r\\naround. The calumet of peace was passed. All in turn partook of the\\r\\nsmoke of the weed which both the civilized and uncivilized man have\\r\\nprized so highly.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile thus employed, a messenger came in from the head chief, who\\r\\nresided in the village on the eminence to which we have alluded. He\\r\\nbrought a message from the chief, inviting the strangers to his\\r\\nresidence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We went with a good will,\" writes M. Marquette. \"The people, who had\\r\\nnever before seen a white man, could never tire looking at us. They\\r\\nthrew themselves upon the grass, by the way-side, to watch as we\\r\\npassed. They ran ahead, and then turned and walked slowly back to\\r\\nexamine us. All this was done without noise and in the most respectful\\r\\nmanner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chief was standing, with two venerable men, at the door of his\\r\\nresidence. The three were entirely destitute of clothing. Each one held\\r\\nthe calumet of peace in his hand. The guests were received with smiles\\r\\nand a few cordial words of welcome. Together they all entered the\\r\\nspacious wigwam. It was very comfortable and even cheerful in its\\r\\naspect, being carpeted, and its sides were lined with mats ingeniously\\r\\nwoven from rushes. The Frenchmen, as before, were placed upon central\\r\\nmats, while all the dignitaries of the village silently entered and\\r\\ntook their seats around.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chief rose, and in a few very appropriate words bade the strangers\\r\\nwelcome to his country. Again the pipe of peace was presented to them\\r\\nand passed the rounds. M. Marquette, who, as we have said, was quite at\\r\\nhome in all matters of Indian etiquette, then arose, and addressing the\\r\\nchief, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have come as friends to visit the nations on this side of the great\\r\\nriver.\" In token of the truth of these words, he made the chief a\\r\\nhandsome present. He then added, \"God, the Father of us all, has had\\r\\npity on you, though you have long been ignorant of Him. He wishes to\\r\\nbecome known to all nations, and has sent me to communicate His will to\\r\\nyou, and wishes you to acknowledge and obey Him.\" Another present was\\r\\nhanded the chief. He then continued, \"My king, the great chief of the\\r\\nFrench, wishes that peace should reign everywhere; that there should be\\r\\nno more wars. The Iroquois, who have been the enemies of the Illinois,\\r\\nhe has subdued.\" Another present was given, in confirmation of the\\r\\ntruth of these words. In conclusion of this brief yet comprehensive\\r\\nspeech, he remarked, \"And now I have only to say that we entreat you to\\r\\ngive us all the information, in your power, of the sea into which the\\r\\ngreat river runs, and of the nations through whom we must pass on our\\r\\nway to reach it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chief rose, and addressing Father Marquette, said, \"I thank thee,\\r\\nBlackgown, and thee also,\" bowing to M. Joliet, \"for taking so much\\r\\npains to come and visit us. Never has the earth been so beautiful to\\r\\nus, and never has the sun shone so brightly upon us as to-day. Never\\r\\nhas our river been so calm or so free from rocks. Your canoes have\\r\\nswept them away. Never has our tobacco had so fine a flavor, or our\\r\\ncorn been so luxuriant as we behold it to-day, now that you are with\\r\\nus.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, turning to a little Indian captive boy, at his side, whom they\\r\\nhad taken from some hostile tribe, and had adopted into the family of\\r\\nthe chief, he added:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here is my son. I give him to you that you may know my heart. I\\r\\nimplore you to take pity upon me, and upon all my nation. Thou knowest\\r\\nthe Great Spirit who has made us all. Thou speakest to Him and hearest\\r\\nHis word. Ask Him to give me life and health, and to come and dwell\\r\\nwith us, that we may know Him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then led the little captive to the side of M. Marquette. This was in\\r\\nreturn for the first present. Holding in his hand a calumet very highly\\r\\ncarved and ornamented with feathers, he presented it to the father,\\r\\nsaying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is the sacred calumet. It signifies that, wherever you bear it,\\r\\nyou are the messengers of peace. All our tribes will respect it, and\\r\\nwill protect you from every harm.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bowl of the pipe was of some highly polished red stone. The stem,\\r\\nelaborately decorated, was of a reed about two feet long. \"By this\\r\\npresent,\" said he, \"we wish to show our esteem for your chief, whom we\\r\\nmust all revere after the account you have given us of him.\" The third\\r\\nand fourth presents consisted, so far as we can judge from the rather\\r\\nobscure narrative, of two thick mats, one for each of the guests, to\\r\\nserve them for beds on their voyage. At the same time the chief said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg of you, in behalf of the whole nation, not to go any farther\\r\\ndown the river. Your lives will be in the greatest peril.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I replied,\" Father Marquette writes, \"that I did not fear death, and\\r\\nthat I esteemed no happiness greater than that of losing my life for\\r\\nthe glory of God, who made us all. But this, these poor people could\\r\\nnot understand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe council now broke up, and a great feast was given. It consisted of\\r\\nfour courses. The first much resembled what is called in New England\\r\\nhasty pudding. It consisted of Indian meal, and corn pounded fine, and\\r\\nboiled in an earthen pot, and was eaten with melted fat. The master of\\r\\nceremonies took some on a wooden plate, and with a horn spoon, quite\\r\\nneatly made, fed the two Frenchmen as a mother feeds a child.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second course consisted of three boiled fishes. Carefully the bones\\r\\nwere removed, and the Indian who served them placed the food in the\\r\\nmouths of their guests as before. He blew upon it, to be sure that it\\r\\nwas sufficiently cool. For the third course there was brought forward a\\r\\nlarge baked dog. This was considered a great delicacy, and was deemed\\r\\nthe highest compliment which could be shown to a guest. But the\\r\\nprejudices of the Frenchmen were such that they could not eat dog, and\\r\\nthis dish was removed. The fourth course consisted of fat and tender\\r\\ncuts of buffalo meat. This also was placed in their mouths as parents\\r\\nfeed a child.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were three hundred wigwams in the village. After the feast the\\r\\nguests were led into each one of them, and introduced to the inmates.\\r\\nAs they walked through the streets a large crowd accompanied them. Some\\r\\nmen, officiating as a kind of police, were continually haranguing the\\r\\nthrong, urging the people not to press too close, and not to be\\r\\ntroublesome. Many presents were made them of belts and scarfs woven\\r\\nfrom hair and fur, and other small articles of Indian manufacture,\\r\\nbrilliantly colored and richly embroidered with shells. They had also\\r\\nknee-bands and wrist-bands which were quite ornamental.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat night the guests slept in the wigwam of the chief. The next\\r\\nmorning they took leave of their generous entertainers. The chief\\r\\nhimself accompanied them to their canoes, followed by a retinue of\\r\\nnearly six hundred persons.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe cannot record this friendly reception without emotion. How beautiful\\r\\nis peace! How different would the history of this world have been but\\r\\nfor man\\'s inhumanity to man!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The First Exploration of the Mississippi River._\\r\\n\\r\\nRiver Scenery.

Joliet had astronomical instruments with which\\r\\nthey ascertained, with much accuracy, the latitude of all their\\r\\nimportant stopping places. As they state that the two villages, which\\r\\nthey visited, were on the western side of the Mississippi, at the\\r\\nlatitude of forty degrees north, and upon the banks of a stream flowing\\r\\ninto the Great River, it is supposed that these villages were upon the\\r\\nstream now called Des Moines, which forms a part of the boundary\\r\\nbetween Iowa and Missouri. The Indians called the villages Pe-ou-a-sea\\r\\nand Moing-wena. They were probably situated about six miles above the\\r\\npresent city of Keokuk.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was three o\\'clock in the afternoon, of a day near the end of sunny,\\r\\nblooming June, when our voyagers resumed their adventurous tour. Nearly\\r\\nthe whole tribe they had visited stood upon the bank to bid them adieu.\\r\\nThey floated along through a very dreary country of precipitous rocks\\r\\nand jagged cliffs, which quite shut out from their view the magnificent\\r\\nprairie region which was spread out beyond this barrier.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon the smooth surface of one of these rocks, apparently inaccessible,\\r\\nthey saw, with surprise, two figures painted in very brilliant colors\\r\\nand with truly artistic outline. They thought that the painting would\\r\\nhave done honor to any European artist. The figures were of two rather\\r\\nfrightful looking monsters, about the size of a calf, in red, green,\\r\\nand black. Stoddard, in his history of Louisiana, says that these\\r\\npainted monsters, between the Missouri and the Illinois Rivers, still\\r\\nremain in a good degree of preservation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As we were discoursing of them,\" writes Father Marquette, \"sailing\\r\\ngently down a beautiful, still, clear water, we heard the noise of a\\r\\nrapid, into which we were about to fall. I have seen nothing more\\r\\nfrightful. A mass of large trees, entire, with branches, real floating\\r\\nislands, came rushing from the mouth of the river PekitunoÃ¼Ã¬, so\\r\\nimpetuously that we could not, without great danger, expose ourselves\\r\\nto pass across. The agitation was so great that the water was all\\r\\nmuddy, and could not get clear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the rush and the roar of the incoming billows of the terrible\\r\\nMissouri, the most tremendous river upon this globe. It enters the\\r\\nMississippi through a channel half a mile in breadth, rushing down with\\r\\na sort of maniacal fury, from its sources among the Rocky Mountains at\\r\\nthe distance of three thousand and ninety-six miles. Its whole course,\\r\\nfrom its rise to its entrance into the Gulf of Mexico, is four thousand\\r\\nthree hundred and forty-nine miles. More than two hundred and fifty\\r\\nyears after this, Mr. George Catlin ascended this river in the first\\r\\nsteamer which ever ventured to breast its torrent.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt took the steamer three months to ascend to the mouth of the\\r\\nYellowstone, two thousand miles from the city of St. Louis. At this\\r\\npoint the American Fur Company had erected a very substantial fort,\\r\\nthree hundred feet square, for the protection of their property against\\r\\nthe savages. The banks of the stream were lined with the villages of\\r\\nthe Indians. Their wigwams were of a great variety of structure. The\\r\\nscenes presented were astonishing in their wild and picturesque aspect.\\r\\nCrowds of weird-like savages would often be collected on the bluffs,\\r\\nwatching the appalling phenomenon of the passing steamer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Missouri is different, perhaps, from any other river in the world.\\r\\nIts boiling, turbid waters rush impetuously on, in an unceasing\\r\\ncurrent, for hundreds of leagues, with scarcely a cove, an eddy, or any\\r\\nresting place where a canoe can be tranquilly moored. The Indian name\\r\\nof the river signifies Muddy Water. It is so opaque, like a cup of\\r\\nchocolate, that a newly coined shilling, placed in a tumbler, cannot be\\r\\nseen through the eighth part of an inch of the water.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor nearly a thousand miles the whole bed of the stream was impeded\\r\\nwith gigantic trees, torn from the rich alluvial banks, forming snags\\r\\nand sawyers and rafts, through which, often with difficulty, the\\r\\nsteamer cut her way. Every island and sandbar was covered with dreary\\r\\nlooking masses of driftwood of every conceivable variety.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis desolate and savage aspect of the rushing flood is much relieved\\r\\nby the aspect of marvellous beauty often presented on the banks. It was\\r\\nalmost a fairy scene. Hills and vales, bluffs and ravines, were\\r\\ncontinually presented in successions of sublimity and beauty which\\r\\ncharmed the eye. Prairies were often spread out before them of\\r\\nboundless expanse, upon which vast herds, often numbering thousands, of\\r\\nbuffaloes, elks, and antelopes, were seen grazing. In the gloomy\\r\\nforests, wolves were roaming. Mountain goats bounded over the cliffs.\\r\\nAnd at times, the air seemed darkened with the myriad birds which rose\\r\\nfrom the tall grass.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was one twelve-pound, and three or four eight-pound cannon on\\r\\nboard the steamer. At every village which was passed, the banks would\\r\\nbe crowded with the astounded natives. Mischievously, the captain would\\r\\norder all the cannon to be simultaneously discharged. The effect upon\\r\\nthe terrified savages was ludicrous in the extreme. They were all\\r\\nthrown into utter consternation. The more devout threw themselves upon\\r\\nthe ground, and, hiding their faces, cried to the Great Spirit for\\r\\nprotection. The cowards, with the women and the children, ran screaming\\r\\nback into the prairie, or behind the hills. Occasionally, a little band\\r\\nof veteran warriors, the bravest of the brave, would stand their\\r\\nground, ready to meet the terrors of even a supernatural foe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sometimes,\" writes Catlin, \"they were thrown neck and heels over each\\r\\nother\\'s heads and shoulders--men, women, children and dogs; sage,\\r\\nsachem, old and young, all in a mass--at the frightful discharge of the\\r\\nsteam from the escape-pipe, which the captain of the boat let loose\\r\\namong them, for his own fun and amusement.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs our voyagers, in their birch bark canoes, passed the mouth of this\\r\\nwonderful stream, they had no conception of the scenes which were\\r\\ntranspiring in thousands of Indian villages on its far-distant waters.\\r\\nThey began now to think, from the course of the Mississippi, that it\\r\\nmust flow into the Gulf of Mexico. They had however learned, from the\\r\\nIndians, that if they were to ascend the Missouri, or, as they called\\r\\nit, PekitanoÃ¼Ã¬, five or six days\\' sail, they would come to a very\\r\\nbeautiful prairie, ninety-five miles long. This splendid country, which\\r\\nwas represented as an Eden of loveliness, the Indians said could be\\r\\neasily crossed, carrying their canoes. They could then take another\\r\\nriver which ran southwest into a small lake. This was the source of\\r\\nanother large and deep river, which emptied into the western sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn subsequent years, this description of the Indians was found to be\\r\\nunexpectedly correct. By ascending the Missouri to the Platte River,\\r\\nand following that stream to its source among the Rocky Mountains, the\\r\\ntraveller is brought within a few leagues of the Colorado, which flows\\r\\ninto the Gulf of California. Having passed the dangerous rush of the\\r\\nMissouri, as it entered into the Mississippi, and floating upon the\\r\\nsurface of their combined waters, they came, after the sail, as they\\r\\njudged, of about sixty miles, to the mouth of another large river, of\\r\\ngentle current, and whose waters were of crystal purity, flowing in\\r\\nfrom the east. The Indians very appropriately called it Wabash, which\\r\\nsignified Beautiful River. The French subsequently called it La Belle\\r\\nRiviÃ¨re. We have given it the name of Ohio, appropriating the name\\r\\nWabash to one of its most important tributaries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe voyagers learned that this stream was fringed with a succession of\\r\\nIndian villages. The various tribes were peaceful, averse to war. In\\r\\none district there was a cluster of twenty-three villages; in another,\\r\\nof eighteen. But alas for man! It would seem that the fallen children\\r\\nof Adam were determined that there should be no happiness in this\\r\\nworld. The ferocious Iroquois would send their war parties, hundreds of\\r\\nmiles through the wilderness, to make unprovoked attacks upon these\\r\\nunwarlike people. They would rob them of their harvests, wantonly burn\\r\\ntheir wigwams, kill and scalp men, women, and children, and carry off\\r\\ncaptives to torture and burn at the stake, in barbarian festivities.\\r\\n\\r\\nNear the mouth of this river they found deposits of unctuous earth,\\r\\nhaving quite brilliantly the colors of red, purple, and violet. Father\\r\\nHennepin rubbed some of the red upon his paddle. The constant use of\\r\\nthat paddle in the water, for fifteen days, did not efface the color.\\r\\nThis was a favorite resort of the Indians to obtain materials for\\r\\npainting their persons.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey now entered the region of that terrible pest, the mosquito.\\r\\nElephants, lions, tigers, can be exterminated. The mosquito bids\\r\\ndefiance to all mortal powers. The Indians would build a scaffolding of\\r\\npoles, a mere grate-work, which would give free passage to smoke. A few\\r\\npieces of bark, overhead, sheltered them from the rain, and the\\r\\nexcessive heat of the sun. Upon these poles they slept, kindling\\r\\nsmouldering fires beneath. They could better endure the suffocating\\r\\nfumes which thus enveloped them and drove away their despicable\\r\\ntormenters, than bear the poison of their stings. The voyagers were\\r\\ngreatly annoyed by these insects.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they were thus swept down the infinite windings of the stream, day\\r\\nafter day, mostly at the will of the current, they perceived one\\r\\nmorning, much to their surprise, a small band of Indians on the shore,\\r\\narmed with guns. The savages seemed very much at their ease, and waited\\r\\nthe approach of the canoes. Father Hennepin stood up and waved toward\\r\\nthem his peace calumet, with its imposing decoration of feathers. His\\r\\ncompanions held their muskets in readiness to repel any assault.\\r\\nDrawing near the shore, the father addressed them in the Huron\\r\\nlanguage. They did not understand him, but made friendly signs for the\\r\\nparty to land. The Indians led the Frenchmen into their wigwams and\\r\\nfeasted them upon buffalo steaks, with bear\\'s fat, and some very\\r\\ndelicious wild plums.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt appeared that these Indians were a band of warriors, probably from\\r\\nthe Tuscarora nation. They had seen the Spaniards, on the Florida\\r\\ncoast, and had purchased of them guns, axes, and knives. They kept\\r\\ntheir powder in strong glass bottles. From them they learned that a ten\\r\\ndays\\' voyage down the rapid current of the Mississippi would bring them\\r\\nto the ocean. The indefatigable missionary endeavored to give them some\\r\\nidea of God, and of salvation through Jesus Christ, who came to seek\\r\\nand save the lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now, with renewed courage, our adventurers entered their canoes and\\r\\nresumed their paddles. The prairies, which had so long delighted their\\r\\neyes, gradually disappeared, and the dense forest lined both sides of\\r\\nthe stream. It was very evident, however, that upon the other side of\\r\\nthe forest-crowned eminences, the prairies continued to extend in all\\r\\ntheir sublimity and beauty; for they often heard the bellowing, as the\\r\\nroar of distant thunders, from thousands of wild cattle roving the\\r\\nplains.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had now descended to nearly the thirty-third degree of north\\r\\nlatitude, when they came to a large Indian village, situated upon a\\r\\nplain raised but a few feet above the level of the water. These Indians\\r\\nhad undoubtedly received some great outrage from the Spaniards; for no\\r\\nsooner did they catch a sight of the Europeans than they were thrown\\r\\ninto great commotion, and all their warriors rallied for battle. They\\r\\nwere evidently aware that a few men, armed with the dreadful musket,\\r\\nmight overpower a large number who wielded only the Indian weapons of\\r\\nwarfare.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese warriors were armed with bows and arrows, javelins, and war\\r\\nclubs. They seemed to know that the invisible bullet could strike with\\r\\ndeath far beyond the reach of any of their missiles. They moved\\r\\ntherefore with great caution. In those southern latitudes the birch\\r\\ntree, from whose bark the canoes of the northern Indians were made, did\\r\\nnot thrive. Their boats were made of large logs, hollowed out and\\r\\nneatly shaped. They were often ornamented with infinite labor. Some of\\r\\nthe warriors prepared to overwhelm the strangers with a shower of\\r\\narrows from the land. Others embarked in their larger boats to ascend\\r\\nthe river, and others to descend, so as to cut off all possibility of\\r\\nretreat.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the voyagers drew near the shore, Father Marquette stood up in his\\r\\ncanoe, though exposed to imminent danger of being pierced by their\\r\\narrows, and earnestly waved the calumet of peace, at the same time, as\\r\\nhe writes, imploring the aid of \"our patroness and guide, the Blessed\\r\\nVirgin Immaculate. And indeed,\" he continues, \"we needed her aid, for\\r\\nwe heard, from afar, the Indians exciting one another to the combat by\\r\\ncontinual yells.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the terror and tumult of the moment the calumet had not been seen.\\r\\nBut as soon as some of the chiefs caught sight of it, they rushed into\\r\\nthe water, threw their bows and arrows into the canoes, which they\\r\\nseized and brought to the shore. Father Marquette and M. Joliet were so\\r\\nfamiliar with the customs of the Indians that they understood this to\\r\\nbe a friendly movement, and they no longer felt any great anxiety;\\r\\nthough they were aware that, through some sudden outbreak of the savage\\r\\nsense of revenge, they might lose their lives. The good father\\r\\naddressed them in six Indian languages, none of which they understood.\\r\\nAt last an old man came forward, who spoke a little Illinois.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery friendly relations were soon established. They made the Indians\\r\\nseveral valuable presents, and informed them of their desire to find\\r\\nthe way to the ocean. \"They perfectly understood our meaning,\" writes\\r\\nFather Marquette, \"but I know not whether they understood what I told\\r\\nthem of God, and the things which concerned their salvation. It is a\\r\\nseed cast in the earth, which will bear its fruit in season.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indians, in return, presented them with corn pounded into meal, and\\r\\nsome fishes. They said that, at some distance farther down the river,\\r\\nthere was a large village called Akamsea; that there they could learn\\r\\nall they wished to know respecting the course and the out-flow of the\\r\\nFather of Waters. The voyagers slept in the wigwams of the Indians\\r\\nduring the night, though the father confesses that it was not without\\r\\nsome uneasiness. The Akamsea, to which the Indians referred, was what\\r\\nwe now call Arkansas.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is supposed that this village was near the Indian village of\\r\\nGuachoya, where the unhappy De Soto, whose romantic history we have\\r\\ngiven in a previous volume of this series, breathed his last, one\\r\\nhundred and fifty years before. In the narrative which has descended to\\r\\nus of that ill-fated and cruel expedition the historian writes:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"The same day, July 2, 1543, that we left Aminoya, we passed by\\r\\n    Guachoya, where the Indians tarried for us in their canoes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was at Aminoya that De Moscoso, who succeeded De Soto, built his\\r\\nlittle fleet of seven strong barges, with which the Spaniards\\r\\ndescended, in a voyage of sixteen days, to the mouth of the river. The\\r\\nSpaniards were as ignorant of the sources of the mighty river upon\\r\\nwhich they were sailing, as were the French of the termination of the\\r\\nmajestic flood, which they had discovered nearly two thousand miles,\\r\\nfar away amidst the lakes and prairies of the north.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning, at an early hour, the Frenchmen resumed their voyage.\\r\\nA party of ten Indians accompanied them, leading the way in one of\\r\\ntheir large boats. The old man, who understood a little of the Illinois\\r\\nlanguage, also went with them as an interpreter. When they had\\r\\ndescended the river nearly thirty miles, and were within about a mile\\r\\nand a half of the Arkansas village, they saw two boats, crowded with\\r\\nwarriors, push out from the shore, and advancing to meet them. The keen\\r\\neyes of the savages had probably discerned the Indian boat which led\\r\\nthe frail canoes of the Frenchmen. They knew that persons thus\\r\\napproaching could come with no hostile attempt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chief of this party, distinguished by his gorgeous dress, stood up\\r\\nin his boat, and, waving the plumed calumet, sung, in a very plaintive\\r\\nbut agreeable tone, some Indian ode of welcome. He came with smiles and\\r\\nfriendly signs alongside of the two birch canoes which kept close\\r\\ntogether. First, having taken a few whiffs from the pipe, he presented\\r\\nit to them to smoke. Then, having given them some bread, made of Indian\\r\\nmeal, he made signs for them to follow him to the shore.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chief had a large scaffolding, such as we have before described, as\\r\\na protection from the mosquitoes. It also afforded a cool shelter from\\r\\nthe rays of an almost tropical sun. The ground floor was carpeted with\\r\\nvery fine rush mats. In the centre of this spacious awning, the\\r\\nFrenchmen were seated, as in the post of honor. The head chief, with\\r\\nhis subordinates, surrounded them. Then the encircling warriors,\\r\\nseveral hundred in number, took their seats. A motley but perfectly\\r\\norderly crowd of men, women, and children gathered around as witnesses\\r\\nof the scene.\\r\\n\\r\\nFortunately there was a young warrior there who had travelled, and who\\r\\nwas much more familiar with the Illinois language than the old man who\\r\\nhad accompanied the voyagers as interpreter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Through him,\" says the faithful missionary, \"I first spoke to the\\r\\nassembly by the ordinary presents. They admired what I told them of\\r\\nGod, and the mysteries of our holy faith, and showed a great desire to\\r\\nkeep me with them to instruct them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn answer to inquiries in reference to the sea, they said that it could\\r\\nbe easily reached, in their canoes, in ten days. They, however, stated\\r\\nthat they knew but little about the nations who inhabited the lower\\r\\npart of the river, because they were their enemies. These Indians had\\r\\nhatchets, knives, and beads. This proved that, in some way, they had\\r\\nheld intercourse with Europeans. Upon being consulted on this question,\\r\\nit appeared that they had obtained them through the Spaniards in\\r\\nFlorida and Mexico. They warned the voyagers not to go any farther down\\r\\nthe river, as they would certainly be attacked and destroyed by the war\\r\\nparties of these hostile bands.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile this conference was going on, which continued for several hours,\\r\\nthe Indians were continually presenting their guests with plates of\\r\\nfood, which consisted principally of meal-pudding, roast corn, and\\r\\ndogs\\' flesh. The Indians were very courteous. But it was not a powerful\\r\\nor war-like tribe. They often had but a meagre supply of food, as the\\r\\nferocity of their surrounding enemies prevented them from wandering far\\r\\nin pursuit of game.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir main reliance was upon corn. They sowed it at all seasons,\\r\\nraising three crops a year. While some fields were just sprouting,\\r\\nothers were in the soft and milky state suitable for roasting, and\\r\\nother fields were waving with the ripe and golden harvest. These\\r\\nsouthern tribes were generally much more advanced in the arts than\\r\\nthose farther north. They manufactured many quite admirable articles of\\r\\npottery for household use. It is said that some of them were hardly\\r\\ninferior in form and finish to the exquisite vases found in Herculaneum\\r\\nand Pompeii.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill they were in many respects degraded savages, of loathsome habits,\\r\\nbut little elevated above the brutes. Many of the men wandered about\\r\\nwithout any clothing. The women were not regarded with any honor. They\\r\\nwere beasts of burden, dressed in wretched skins, without any\\r\\nornaments. Their wigwams were long and wide, made of bark, with a\\r\\nsingle central entrance. Almost like the cattle, they slept together at\\r\\nthe two extremities, upon mat-covered elevations, raised about two feet\\r\\nfrom the ground. From the description of Father Marquette, we should\\r\\ninfer that, in this melancholy village, the chiefs alone enjoyed the\\r\\nluxury of sleeping upon poles enveloped with suffocating smoke to drive\\r\\naway the mosquitoes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We ate no fruit there,\" writes Marquette, \"but watermelons. If they\\r\\nknew how to cultivate their grounds they might have plenty of all\\r\\nkinds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening M. Joliet and Father Marquette held a conference in\\r\\nreference to their future course. They had ascertained that they were\\r\\nat 33Â° 40\\' north latitude. The basin of the Gulf of Mexico was at 31Â°\\r\\n40\\'. Though the Indians had said that they could reach the sea in ten\\r\\ndays, it was manifest that they could easily accomplish the distance in\\r\\nfour or five. The question was consequently settled that the\\r\\nMississippi ran into the Gulf of Mexico. To decide this point was the\\r\\ngreat object of their voyage. Spanish outrages had exasperated all the\\r\\nIndians along the southern coast. The voyagers could not prosecute\\r\\ntheir enterprise any farther, but at the imminent peril of their lives.\\r\\nShould they thus perish, the result of their discoveries would, for a\\r\\nlong time, be lost to the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey feared the Spaniards even more than they did the savages. The\\r\\nSpaniards, jealous of the power of France, would certainly hold them as\\r\\nprisoners, if they could take them, and would not improbably put them\\r\\nto death to prevent the fact of their having descended the whole course\\r\\nof the Mississippi from being known. They therefore wisely determined\\r\\nto retrace their steps with all energy. On the 17th of July they left\\r\\nthe village of Akamsea, near the mouth of the Arkansas River, to stem\\r\\nthe strong current of the Mississippi on their return. At high-water\\r\\nthe vast flood, a mile in width, rushed along at the rate of five or\\r\\nsix miles an hour. They found it very difficult to force their way\\r\\nagainst this current. We have no particular account of the incidents of\\r\\ntheir long and laborious return voyage. When they had reached the\\r\\nlatitude of thirty-eighth degree north, they came to the mouth of the\\r\\nIllinois River. The Indians informed them that this would be a shorter\\r\\nroute to Lake Michigan than to go up the Mississippi still farther to\\r\\nthe Wisconsin River. They therefore entered this stream, which takes\\r\\nits rise within six miles of the lake. In the glowing account which\\r\\nFather Marquette gives of this river, he writes:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"We had seen nothing like this river for the fertility of the land,\\r\\n    its prairies, woods, wild cattle, stags, deer, wild-cats, bustards,\\r\\n    swans, ducks, parrots, and even beavers. It has many little lakes\\r\\n    and tributary rivers. The stream on which we sailed is broad, deep,\\r\\n    and gentle, for sixty-five leagues. During the spring, and part of\\r\\n    the summer, when the rivers are full, the portage is only a mile\\r\\n    and a half in length.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey ascended the Illinois until, by a short portage, they could\\r\\ntransport their canoes across the prairie to the Chicago River.\\r\\nDescending this stream to its mouth, where the thronged city of Chicago\\r\\nnow stands, but which was then only a dreary expanse of marshy prairie,\\r\\nthey paddled up the western coast of Lake Michigan until they reached\\r\\nthe mission at Green Bay, about the middle of September. About two\\r\\nmonths were spent in the toilsome voyage from Arkansas.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Wool, Inspector-General of the army of the United States, has\\r\\nmade, from a personal acquaintance with the route, the following\\r\\nestimate of the distances of the several stages of this eventful\\r\\njourney:\\r\\n\\r\\n    From Green Bay up Fox River to the portage              175 miles\\r\\n    From the portage down the Wisconsin to the Mississippi  175   \"\\r\\n    From the mouth of the Wisconsin to the mouth of the\\r\\n      Arkansas                                             1087   \"\\r\\n    From the Arkansas to the Illinois River                 547   \"\\r\\n    From the mouth of the Illinois to Chicago               305   \"\\r\\n    From Chicago to Green Bay, by the lake shore            260   \"\\r\\n                                                          _____\\r\\n        Total                                             2,549\\r\\n\\r\\nThe accompanying fac-simile of a map attached to Marquette\\'s Journal,\\r\\nreduced from the original, and which we take from Mr. Sparks\\'s brief\\r\\nbut admirable sketch of Marquette\\'s Life, will give the reader a very\\r\\nclear idea of the route he pursued. The dotted line from the\\r\\nMississippi to the Illinois, marked \"Chemin du retour,\" is evidently a\\r\\nmistake, added by some other hand. It is clear, from the narrative,\\r\\nthat the voyagers returned up the Illinois River.\\r\\n\\r\\nFather Marquette, who was never known to utter a murmuring word, and\\r\\nwho was serene and cheerful amidst the sorest trials, was so utterly\\r\\nexhausted by the toils of the expedition that he could proceed no\\r\\nfarther than Green Bay. Here M. Joliet separated from him and continued\\r\\nhis route, in a birch canoe, along the vast expanse of Huron, Erie, and\\r\\nOntario, and down the St. Lawrence to Montreal. In descending the\\r\\nrapids of the river his canoe was over-set and all his papers lost, he\\r\\nnarrowly escaping with his life. He subsequently dictated, from memory,\\r\\na few pages of the incidents of the voyage; but the manuscript of\\r\\nFather Marquette alone remained to tell the wondrous story. This was\\r\\nsent to France, and there published.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven Marquette had no conception of the true grandeur of that valley he\\r\\nhad entered, extending from the Alleghany ridges to the Rocky\\r\\nMountains. Still, when the tidings of his wonderful discoveries reached\\r\\nQuebec, the exciting intelligence was received with the ringing of\\r\\nbells, with salvos of artillery, and, most prominent and important of\\r\\nall, by nearly the whole population, led by the clergy and other\\r\\ndignitaries of the place, going in procession to the cathedral where\\r\\nthe Te Deum was sung in thanksgiving to God.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Marquette\\'s Last Voyage, and Death._\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Departure from Green Bay.

It is said that he was remarkably genial and\\r\\ncompanionable, fond of pleasantry, ever greeting others with pleasant\\r\\nwords and benignant smiles. He had promised the Illinois Indians that\\r\\nhe would return to them, to teach them the religion of peace and\\r\\ngood-will brought to the world by the Son of God.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis health being somewhat recruited, he set out, by direction of his\\r\\nsuperiors, with two boatmen, Pierre and Jacques, to establish a mission\\r\\namong these Indians, who were anxiously awaiting his arrival. The\\r\\nmission at Green Bay was at the southern extremity of that inland sea.\\r\\nTaking their canoe and all their effects upon their shoulders, they\\r\\ncrossed the peninsula, which separated the bay from the lake, through\\r\\nan Indian trail about thirty miles in length. They then launched their\\r\\ncanoe upon the broad surface of Lake Michigan. The cold gales of\\r\\nNovember had now begun to plough the surface of this inland sea. Their\\r\\nprogress was very slow. Often the billows were such that the canoe\\r\\ncould not ride safely over them. Then they landed, and, in the chill\\r\\nNovember breezes, trudged along the shore, bearing all their effects\\r\\nupon their shoulders!\\r\\n\\r\\nIce formed upon the margin of the water, and several snow-storms\\r\\nimpeded their march, adding greatly to their discomfort. But not a\\r\\nrepining word escaped the lips of Father Marquette. It was but a dismal\\r\\nshelter they could rear, for the night, on the bleak shore. Through\\r\\nthis exposure his health began rapidly to fail. It took them nearly\\r\\nfour weeks to reach the mouth of the Chicago River. They ascended the\\r\\nriver several leagues, until they came to a small cluster of Indian\\r\\nwigwams. The savages were poor, but few in number, and their abodes\\r\\ncomfortless. But PÃ¨re Marquette was so sick that they could go no\\r\\nfarther. These Indians were of the Miami tribe.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the voyagers built a small log-cabin, and, destitute of what many\\r\\nwould deem the absolute necessaries of life, passed the remaining weeks\\r\\nof the dreary winter. One would suppose that the lone missionary must\\r\\nat times have contrasted painfully his then situation, with the\\r\\nluxuries he had enjoyed in the ancestral castle in which he was\\r\\ncradled. A few wretched wigwams were scattered over the snow-whitened\\r\\nplains, where poverty, destitution, and repulsive social habits\\r\\nreigned, such as is perhaps never witnessed in civilized life.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis home was but a cabin of logs, with the interstices stuffed with\\r\\nmoss. The roof was covered with bark. The window was merely a hole cut\\r\\nthrough the logs. In storms a piece of cloth hung over it, which\\r\\npartially kept out wind and rain. The fireplace was one corner of the\\r\\nroom, with a hole in the roof through which the smoke ascended. Often\\r\\nthe state of the atmosphere was such that the cabin was filled with\\r\\nsmothering smoke. A few mats, woven coarsely from bulrushes, covered a\\r\\nportion of the earth floor. A mat was his bed. A log, covered with a\\r\\nmat, was his chair; his food was pounded corn, and fishes and flesh of\\r\\nanimals, broiled on the coals; his companions, savages. Such was the\\r\\nhome which this noble man had cheerfully accepted in exchange for the\\r\\nbaronial splendors of his ancestors. It was two hundred years ago.\\r\\nFather Marquette has received his rewards. His earthly labors and\\r\\nsacrifices were for but about twenty years. For two hundred years he\\r\\nhas occupied a mansion, which God reared for him in heaven. There he is\\r\\nnow, with his crown, his robe, and his harp, with angel companionship.\\r\\nAnd there he is to dwell forever.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is something exceedingly beautiful in the simplicity of the\\r\\nGospel of Christ. God, in the person of his Son, came to earth and\\r\\nsuffered and died to make atonement for human sin. All who will abandon\\r\\nsin, and try to live doing nothing wrong, and endeavoring to do\\r\\neverything that is right, He will forgive, and make forever happy in\\r\\nheaven.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the Gospel; the Good News. God is no respecter of persons; but\\r\\nin every nation, he that feareth him and worketh righteousness, is\\r\\naccepted with him. The loitering Indians, ignorant, degraded, wicked,\\r\\ngathered in constant groups around the fire, in the cabin of the sick\\r\\nChristian teacher. And when he told them of that happy world where they\\r\\nshall hunger no more, neither thirst any more, and where God shall wipe\\r\\naway all tears from their eyes, the truth came home to their hearts,\\r\\nand became its own witness.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet here, as elsewhere, the Gospel of Jesus found its bitter\\r\\nantagonists. With the Indians, as in every city and town in\\r\\nChristendom, there were those who did not wish to be holy. They hated a\\r\\nGospel which demanded the abandonment of sin. These men, with bloody\\r\\ntomahawks and gory scalping knives, and who, from infancy, had been\\r\\npractising the hideous war-whoop; who consider the glory of their\\r\\nmanhood to depend upon the number of enemies they had slain, and whose\\r\\ngreatest delight consisted in listening to the shrieks, and witnessing\\r\\nthe convulsions of their agonized victims at the stake, denounced the\\r\\nChristian teacher, as the Jews denounced the Son of God, crying out\\r\\n\"Crucify him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery day Father Marquette was sinking in languor, which both he and\\r\\nhis companions supposed to be a monition of speedily approaching death.\\r\\nAnd yet he was a cheerful and happy man. All incomers at his cabin were\\r\\ngreeted with smiles. Death had no terror. Brighter and brighter grew\\r\\nthe path, as he drew nearer to the celestial city. His log-cabin was\\r\\ncontinually crowded with those who sought instruction. The two humble\\r\\ncompanions who attended him were devout men, though uneducated, and in\\r\\nlife\\'s lowly station. They joined heartily in the devotions of the\\r\\ncabin. The voices of the three were joined in matins and vespers, and\\r\\nfloated sweetly over those dreary wastes, where such heavenly strains\\r\\nhad never been heard before.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouis XIV. was then upon the throne of France. He was one of the\\r\\ngreatest, most powerful, most opulent of all earthly monarchs. The\\r\\nwealth and the genius of earth could construct nothing more grand than\\r\\nhis palaces at Marly and Versailles. His banqueting-hall was\\r\\nunsurpassed by any other hall ever reared upon this globe. His\\r\\nchambers, his saloons, his galleries, are still visited by astonished\\r\\nand admiring thousands. And yet no one, familiar with his life, will\\r\\ndeny that Father Marquette, in his log-cabin, surrounded by Indian\\r\\nwigwams, probably passed a happier winter than did Louis XIV., amidst\\r\\nthe most dazzling splendors which ever surrounded a mortal.\\r\\n\\r\\nChristmas came. It was made by the three a season of special devotion,\\r\\nthat God would so reinvigorate Father Marquette, as to enable him to\\r\\nfulfil his promise, and visit the Illinois Indians, and teach them the\\r\\nGospel. These devotions were called a Novena, which was a nine days\\'\\r\\nprayer-meeting. Their prayers were heard. Contrary to all reasonable\\r\\nexpectation, he so far regained his strength as to be able, on the 29th\\r\\nof March, to resume his journey. The chill winds of departing winter\\r\\nstill swept the plains. Storms of sleet often beat upon them. The\\r\\nground, alternately thawing and freezing, was frequently whitened with\\r\\nsnow. And still these heroic men, with chivalry never surpassed in the\\r\\nannals of knighthood, pressed on. Their journey was slow. Sometimes\\r\\nthey floated upon the stream. Again they followed the Indian trail\\r\\nthrough forest and prairie. After traversing a route about a hundred\\r\\nand fifty miles in length, they reached, on the 8th of April, the\\r\\nKankakee River, an important tributary of the Illinois. At this point,\\r\\nwhich is now in the present county of Kankakee, and near where the\\r\\nvillage of Rockport stands, the Illinois Indians had their large and\\r\\npopulous village.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe missionary was received, we are told, as an angel from heaven. He\\r\\nassembled all the chiefs of the tribe, with the renowned warriors, that\\r\\nwith imposing ceremonies he might announce to them the object of his\\r\\ncoming, and impress them with the momentous importance of his message.\\r\\nThere was no wigwam sufficiently capacious to accommodate such a\\r\\nmultitude as the occasion would assemble.\\r\\n\\r\\nNear the village there was a smooth, verdant, beautiful prairie, richly\\r\\ncarpeted with the velvet green of early spring. On a mild and sunny\\r\\nmorning a wonderful crowd of savages--men, women, and children--were\\r\\nseen crowding to the appointed station. The chiefs were dressed in\\r\\ntruly gorgeous habiliments, of plumes, skins richly embroidered and\\r\\nfringed, and brilliantly colored. Their robes were more showy than any\\r\\ncourt-dress ever witnessed at Windsor Castle or the Tuileries. The\\r\\nwarriors, with proud demeanor and stately tread, marched along, with\\r\\nquivers of arrows at their backs, and bows in their hands. Tomahawks\\r\\nand scalping knives were ostentatiously displayed, and the scalps of\\r\\nenemies dangled at their javelin points, as badges of their nobility.\\r\\nOf these they were more proud than were ever English, French, or\\r\\nSpanish grandees of the decoration of stars or garters. The women and\\r\\nthe dogs came next. They were alike regarded as necessary drudges to\\r\\nbear burdens, and to be fed with the refuse which their masters left.\\r\\nThen came the boys and girls, many of them half naked, shouting,\\r\\nlaughing, racing, engaging in all the uncouth merriment of a savage\\r\\ngala day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spot selected for the council was decorated according to the most\\r\\napproved fashion of the people and their times. The ground was covered\\r\\nwith mats, made of the skins of bears and other animals. Posts were\\r\\nplanted, draped and festooned with green boughs. Upon each of the four\\r\\nsides of the square, the good father, who had ever been taught to\\r\\nregard with the utmost veneration the Mother of Jesus, hung a picture\\r\\nof the Blessed Virgin, that all might gaze upon her sad yet beautiful\\r\\nfeatures.\\r\\n\\r\\nFather Marquette took his seat upon a mat, in the centre of the\\r\\nenclosure. Then the chiefs, and the veteran warriors, who in many a\\r\\nbloody foray had won renown, took their seats around him. Silently and\\r\\nwith the dignity becoming great men, they assumed their positions. The\\r\\nyoung men, who had not yet signalized themselves, and who were ever\\r\\neager to go upon the war-path, that they might return with their\\r\\ntrophies of gory scalps, to receive the applause of the nation as\\r\\nbraves, came next.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn respect to the war spirit, which is one of the most direful traits\\r\\nof our fallen race, there is but little difference between the\\r\\ncivilized and uncivilized man. I was once breakfasting with one of the\\r\\nmost distinguished officers of a European army. To my question whether\\r\\nthe officers generally wished for peace or war, he replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"War, of course. In times of peace promotion comes slowly. But upon the\\r\\nbattle field promotions are very rapidly made.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young warriors counted about fifteen hundred. Outside of their\\r\\ncircle, the women and the children were clustered. It was estimated\\r\\nthat the whole population of the village amounted to about three\\r\\nthousand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Illinois Indians were at war with the Miamis, among whom Father\\r\\nMarquette had passed the winter. The Illinois chiefs had obtained of\\r\\nthe traders a few guns. Immediately upon Marquette reaching their\\r\\nvillage, they hastened to entreat of him powder and ball, that they\\r\\nmight fit out an expedition against their foes. Father Marquette rose\\r\\nat the council, and after presenting the chiefs with some valuable\\r\\ngifts, in token of the sincerity of his desire to be their friend and\\r\\ndo them good, addressed them in substance as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not brought you any powder or balls. I do not wish you to fight\\r\\nyour brethren the Miamis. You are all the children of the same Father.\\r\\nYou should love one another. I have come to tell you of God, and to\\r\\nteach you to pray. God, the Great Spirit, came to the world, and became\\r\\na man, whose name was Jesus. He died upon the cross to atone for the\\r\\nsins of all men. And now, if you will cease to sin; if you will love\\r\\nyour Father, the Great Spirit, pray to Him and do everything in your\\r\\npower to please Him, He will bless you, and when you die will take you\\r\\nto dwell with Him and will make you happy forever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was, in general, the address of Father Marquette. Such was ever,\\r\\nin substance, his teaching. Jesus the Christ, and Him crucified, was\\r\\nhis constant theme. Two or three days were spent in similar exercises.\\r\\nThe Indians crowded around the father constantly. They listened to his\\r\\nteachings with respectful and apparently with even joyful attention. He\\r\\nwas pale and emaciate. Even the Indian could perceive, from his feeble\\r\\nvoice and emaciate steps, that he was not far from the grave. On Easter\\r\\nSunday, the faithful missionary, with solemn and imposing ceremonies,\\r\\ntook, if we may so speak, spiritual possession of the land, in the name\\r\\nof Jesus Christ.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rapidly failing health of the missionary, rendered it expedient for\\r\\nhim to endeavor to return to his friends at Green Bay. The poor Indians\\r\\nreally mourned at the idea of his departure. Time hung heavily upon\\r\\ntheir hands. They had but little to think of, and but little to do.\\r\\nLoitering indolently around, from morning till night, it was a great\\r\\nsource of enjoyment to them, to crowd the large wigwam they had built\\r\\nfor the father, to listen to his words, to question him, and to witness\\r\\nthe ceremonies with which he was accustomed to conduct his devotions.\\r\\nThey were therefore much troubled at the thought of his departure, and\\r\\nwere but partially comforted by his repeated assurances that he would\\r\\neither soon return again, or send some one else to continue the mission\\r\\nwhich he had thus commenced.\\r\\n\\r\\nSlowly and feebly he set out on his long journey back to Green Bay. It\\r\\nwas ninety miles from Kankakee to the southern extremity of Lake\\r\\nMichigan. They could paddle in canoes over a portion of the route. But\\r\\nthere were also weary miles of portage which they had to pass over,\\r\\nthrough Indian trails, carrying their canoe, and all their effects,\\r\\nupon their backs. It was a severe undertaking for a sick man, who was\\r\\nso feeble that even if a horse could have been provided for him to\\r\\nride, he could scarcely have held himself upon the saddle.\\r\\n\\r\\nA large party of the Indians accompanied the father, on this weary\\r\\njourney to the lake. They administered to his wants with the tenderest\\r\\ncare, relieving him of every burden, and aiding him over the rough\\r\\nways. At the night encampments, they provided for him a shelter,\\r\\nkindled his fire, cooked his food, and spread for him a couch of leaves\\r\\nand twigs. When they reached a small stream, which ran into the lake,\\r\\nthey placed him as comfortably as possible in his canoe, and intrusting\\r\\nhim to the care of his two faithful boatmen, Jacques and Pierre, bade\\r\\nhim an affectionate farewell.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe savages, after these deeds of almost Christian kindness, returned\\r\\nto their wigwams, to sharpen the edges of their tomahawks, the points\\r\\nof their javelins, the barbs of their arrows; and were soon, with\\r\\nhideous yells, rushing upon their foes the Miamis, burning, killing,\\r\\nscalping--performing deeds of cruelty which ought to cause even demons\\r\\nto blush.\\r\\n\\r\\nFather Marquette was too weak to wield the paddle. He reclined in the\\r\\nbottom of the canoe, with his head slightly elevated, so that he could\\r\\nsee all the beauties of the scenery through which they were passing.\\r\\nHis prayer-book was in his hand; his talk was of heaven; he was\\r\\ncheerful and happy. His companions have testified to the wonderful\\r\\namiability, gentleness, and joy he maintained. He told them plainly\\r\\nthat he should die upon the voyage, but encouraged them to bear\\r\\ncourageously all the hardships they were to encounter on the way,\\r\\nassuring that the Lord would not forsake them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs his attendants plied their paddles he read prayers to them, sang\\r\\nsweet hymns of devotion, and in many fervent utterances commended them\\r\\nand himself to God. He was in no pain. His eye sparkled with animation.\\r\\nHis soul was triumphant. It may be doubted whether, on the broad\\r\\ncontinent of North America, there were, in these hours, an individual\\r\\nto be found more happy than he.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was one of the mornings of lovely May, when this frail birch canoe,\\r\\nwith its three inmates, emerging from a small stream, entered upon the\\r\\nocean-like expanse of Lake Michigan. On the north and the east the\\r\\nmajestic inland sea spread out to the horizon, with no bounds but the\\r\\nsky. For some unexplained reason they decided to take the eastern shore\\r\\nof the lake, on their return voyage, though their outward voyage had\\r\\nbeen by the western shore. They had still a journey of three hundred\\r\\nmiles before them.\\r\\n\\r\\nFather Marquette was so weak that he could no longer help himself. He\\r\\ncould neither move nor stand, and had to be carried from the canoe to\\r\\nthe shore like an infant. At each encampment the attendants would draw\\r\\nthe canoe, with Father Marquette in it, gently upon the beach. They\\r\\nwould then hastily rear a shelter, spread for him a couch of the long\\r\\nand withered herbage, and lay him tenderly upon it. The only food they\\r\\ncould prepare for the fainting invalid, was corn pounded into coarse\\r\\nmeal, mixed with water, and baked in the ashes, with perhaps a slice of\\r\\ngame broiled upon the coals.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus they moved along, day after day, expecting almost every hour that\\r\\nthe death summons would come. On Friday evening, the 27th of May, 1675,\\r\\nhe told them, with a countenance radiant with joy, that on the morrow\\r\\nhe should take his departure for his heavenly home.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gave them minute instructions respecting the place he wished to be\\r\\nselected for his burial; directed how to arrange his hands and feet,\\r\\nand how to wrap him in his robes, for he could have no coffin. While\\r\\none was to read the burial service the other was gently to toll the\\r\\nsmall chapel bell which he bore with him on his mission. The canoe was\\r\\ngliding along near the shore, as the father gave these instructions,\\r\\nreclining upon his mat. The setting sun was sinking apparently into the\\r\\nshoreless waters of the lake, in the west. They were all examining the\\r\\nland, the boatmen searching for a suitable spot for their night\\'s\\r\\nencampment, and the father looking for a good place for his dying bed\\r\\nand his burial.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey came to the mouth of a small, pleasant river, which presented a\\r\\nsheltered cove for their canoe. There was an eminence near by, crowned\\r\\nby a beautiful grove, and commanding a wide prospect of the lake and of\\r\\nthe land. It had a sunny exposure, drained of moisture, and composed of\\r\\njust such soil as seems suitable for a grave. Father Marquette pointed\\r\\nto the eminence in the lone, silent, solitary wilderness, and said,\\r\\n\"There is the spot for my last repose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boatmen ran their canoe up the mouth of the river, a few rods, and\\r\\nlanded. Hastily they threw up a frail camp, kindled a fire, spread down\\r\\na mat for a couch, and placed their revered spiritual father upon it.\\r\\nHe was then left entirely alone, with his God, while his companions\\r\\nwere engaged in unloading the canoe. They were silent and sad, for they\\r\\ncould not but perceive that the dying hour was at hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they returned, Father Marquette gave them his last instructions.\\r\\n\"I thank you, my dear companions,\" he said, \"for all the love and\\r\\ntenderness you have shown me during this voyage. I beg you to pardon me\\r\\nfor the trouble I have given you. Will you also say to all my fathers\\r\\nand brethren in the Ottowa mission that I implore their forgiveness for\\r\\nmy imperfections. I am now very near my home. But I shall not forget\\r\\nyou in heaven. You are very weary with the toils of the day. I shall\\r\\nstill live probably for several hours. I wish you would retire and take\\r\\nthat rest which you so greatly need. I will call you as soon as the\\r\\nlast moments arrive.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey left the cabin with stricken hearts and weeping eyes. The dying\\r\\nChristian was left alone with his God. Who can imagine the peace and\\r\\njoy which must then have filled his heart and suffused his eyes. The\\r\\nvictory was won. Death was conquered. The chariot of Israel and the\\r\\nhorsemen thereof were waiting at the door of the humble cabin, to\\r\\ntransport the victor, through the pathways of the stars, to his throne\\r\\nand his crown. Glorious death! Blissful journey!\\r\\n\\r\\nThree hours passed away, and his feeble voice was heard calling his\\r\\ncompanions to his side. He threw his arms around the neck of each one,\\r\\nand drawing him gently down imprinted a kiss upon each cheek. Then,\\r\\ntaking the crucifix, which he ever wore around his neck, he placed it\\r\\nin the hands of one of them, requesting him to hold that emblem of the\\r\\natoning sacrifice of his Saviour before his eyes until the last moment.\\r\\nThen, inspired with the faith of Stephen the Martyr, clasping his hands\\r\\nand fixing his eyes upon this memorial of God manifest in the flesh, in\\r\\nfervent prayer he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"O Lord God, I thank Thee for the boundless grace Thou hast conferred\\r\\nupon me in permitting me to die in the service of Jesus Christ Thy Son.\\r\\nO God, I thank Thee, that I have been His missionary; and that I am\\r\\npermitted to die, in a cabin, in the depths of the forest, and far\\r\\nremoved from all human aid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were a few moments of perfect silence. No sound fell upon the ear\\r\\nbut the gentle breathing of the dying man. He was then heard feebly to\\r\\nsay, \"I know that my Redeemer liveth.\" Again he said, in accordance\\r\\nwith the faith which he had received from childhood, \"Mary! Mother of\\r\\nJesus my Lord, remember me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly he raised his eyes from the crucifix and looked upward, as if\\r\\na vision of wonderful glory was bursting upon his entranced view. His\\r\\ncountenance shone radiant with joy. A sweet smile was upon his lips.\\r\\nWithout a struggle, without a sigh, his soul took its flight to its\\r\\nhome in heaven. He had fallen asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Asleep in Jesus! Far from thee,\\r\\n      Thy kindred and their graves may be.\\r\\n    But thine is still a blessed sleep,\\r\\n      From which none ever wake to weep.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis two bereaved companions wept bitterly. They laid out the body as\\r\\ndirected; wrapped it in the threadbare garments it so long had worn,\\r\\nand having dug the grave, placed the revered remains within it. While\\r\\none devotedly covered the body with its mother earth, the other tolled\\r\\nthe little bell which had so often summoned them to prayer. They\\r\\nremained upon the spot until the next day. A large cross was made, and\\r\\nplanted firmly in the ground, in a position which would attract the\\r\\nattention of all passing along the shore of the lake. The two faithful\\r\\nboatmen, Jacques and Pierre, then, after kneeling upon the grave in\\r\\nfervent prayer, returned to their canoe and continued the long journey\\r\\nto Green Bay. They reached the mission in safety, with their sad\\r\\ntidings.\\r\\n\\r\\nFather Marquette died at the early age of thirty-eight.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had spent twenty-one years an earnest, self-denying minister of\\r\\nJesus Christ. Twelve of these were in France. Nine were devoted to the\\r\\nsavages of the New World. At the early age of nine years, he became an\\r\\nearnest Christian. Every Saturday was, with this wonderful child, a day\\r\\nof fasting and prayer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were quite a number of Christian Indians at the Mackinaw mission.\\r\\nThey had long known Father Marquette, and revered and loved him. A band\\r\\nof these Indians were, some months after this, on the shores of Lake\\r\\nMichigan, upon a hunting excursion. They sought out the grave of Father\\r\\nMarquette. They took up the remains, carefully enclosed them in a box\\r\\nof birch bark, placed them in one of their canoes, and paddled them,\\r\\nthree hundred miles, to the mission of St. Ignatius.\\r\\n\\r\\nA convoy of canoes, thirty in number, in single file, formed this\\r\\nwonderful funeral procession. It is doubtful whether such a scene was\\r\\never before witnessed on this globe. For more than ten days this band\\r\\nof Indian hunters, in their picturesque costume, silently and solemnly\\r\\npaddled along the shores of the lonely lake, that the remains of their\\r\\nbeloved pastor might repose where they could visit the spot, and honor\\r\\nthem with their testimonials of gratitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they approached the shore, where the mission was established, with\\r\\nits cross-surmounted chapel, surrounded with Indian wigwams, a courier\\r\\nwas sent forward rapidly, in a canoe, to announce the arrival of the\\r\\ncortÃ©ge. The whole community promptly gathered upon the beach. A\\r\\nfuneral procession was formed, led by Fathers Nouvel and Pierson, who\\r\\nwere Superiors of the two missions, one to the Ottawas, and one to the\\r\\nHurons, which were located side by side. Interrogations were first made\\r\\nto verify the fact, that the body they bore was really that of Father\\r\\nMarquette.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two ecclesiastics then chanted the sublime anthem,\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Out of the depths have I cried unto Thee, O Lord.\\r\\n    Lord, hear my voice; let Thine ears be attentive to the voice of\\r\\n        my supplications.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe canoes were still on the water, while quite a throng of the Indians\\r\\ncrowded the shore. With the customary religious ceremonies, the body\\r\\nwas conveyed to the chapel. It remained there for a day, covered with a\\r\\npall. On the morning of the next day, which was the ninth of June, the\\r\\nremains were deposited in a grave, in the middle of the log chapel,\\r\\nwhich we infer had no floor but the earth; there to repose until the\\r\\ntrump of the archangel shall sound, when all who are in their graves\\r\\nshall come forth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Life upon the St. Lawrence and the Lakes Two Hundred Years Ago._\\r\\n\\r\\nBirth of La Salle.

The\\r\\nShip-yard at Lake Erie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout two hundred years ago, a young man, by the name of Robert de la\\r\\nSalle, crossed the Atlantic to seek his fortune in the wilds of Canada.\\r\\nHe was born on the 22d of November, 1643, in the city of Rouen, the\\r\\nancient capital of Normandy,[1] France. He was the child of one of the\\r\\nmost distinguished families, and enjoyed all the advantages of social\\r\\nand educational culture which the refinement and scholarship of those\\r\\ntimes could confer. He was by nature a thoughtful, pensive young man,\\r\\nwhose soul was profoundly moved by the unsearchable mystery of this our\\r\\nearthly being. In very early life he found, in the religion of Jesus, a\\r\\npartial solution of the sublime drama of conflict, sin, and sorrow\\r\\nwhich is being enacted on this globe, and which has no solution\\r\\nwhatever but in the revelations of the Bible.\\r\\n\\r\\n      [1] De La Salle among the Senecas, in 1669. By O. H. Marshall,\\r\\n      Buffalo Historical Society.\\r\\n\\r\\nBorn almost beneath the shadow of the great cathedral of Rouen, and of\\r\\nan ancestry which from time immemorial had been the children of the\\r\\nCatholic Church, and instructed from infancy by revered ecclesiastics\\r\\nof that communion he almost as a matter of necessity accepted\\r\\nChristianity as presented to him in the ritual of the Church of Rome.\\r\\nNature had endowed him with a restless, enterprising spirit, which led\\r\\nhim eagerly to plunge into those wild and perilous adventures from\\r\\nwhich most persons would have turned with dismay.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle received an accomplished education in one of the best\\r\\nseminaries in Europe. Upon graduating, he received from the professors\\r\\na testimonial of his high intellectual attainments and his unblemished\\r\\nmoral character. About the year 1669 he sailed from France for Canada.\\r\\nHis object probably was to accumulate a fortune by the barter of\\r\\nEuropean commodities for the furs and skins obtained by the Indians. He\\r\\npushed forward to the frontiers, established trading houses, and in the\\r\\nwell-freighted birch canoe, explored remote lakes and rivers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that time the whole of the great northwest of this country was an\\r\\nentirely unknown land. No one knew whether the continent was one\\r\\nthousand or ten thousand miles in breadth. It was the general\\r\\nimpression that the waves of the Pacific were dashing against the rocks\\r\\na few miles west of the chain of great lakes which fringed the southern\\r\\nshores of Canada. La Salle was meditating an expedition up the St.\\r\\nLawrence, through the majestic chain of lakes to Lake Superior, from\\r\\nthe western end of which he confidently expected to find easy\\r\\ncommunication with the Pacific Ocean. There he would again spread his\\r\\nadventurous sail, having discovered a new route to China and the\\r\\nIndies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was grandeur in this conception. It would entirely change the\\r\\nthoroughfare of the world\\'s commerce. It would make the French\\r\\npossessions in the New World valuable beyond conception. This\\r\\nall-important route, between Europe and Asia, would be under the\\r\\ncontrol of the French crown.\\r\\n\\r\\nM. Frontenac, an ambitious and energetic Frenchman, was then\\r\\ngovernor-general of Canada. He entered cordially into the plans of La\\r\\nSalle, conferred frequently with him upon the subject, and was sanguine\\r\\nin the expectation that, by this great discovery, his own name would be\\r\\nimmortalized, and he would secure the highest applause from the Grande\\r\\nMonarque, Louis XIV.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs early as the year 1660, the Indians had reported, at Quebec, that\\r\\nmany leagues west of the great lakes there was a wonderful river, the\\r\\nGreat River, the Father of Waters, the most majestic stream in the\\r\\nworld, flowing from the unexplored solitudes of the wilderness in the\\r\\nnorth, far away into the unknown regions of the south.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day a birch canoe, with a little band of hardy, wayworn voyagers,\\r\\nFrench and Indians, came paddling down the swift current of the St.\\r\\nLawrence and ran their boat upon the beach where the little cluster of\\r\\ndwellings stood, called Quebec. They brought the startling intelligence\\r\\nthat Father Marquette, a great and good man whom all knew, had\\r\\ndiscovered the Great River, which the Indians called the Mississippi,\\r\\nand had followed down its majestic current for hundreds of leagues,\\r\\nuntil he had reached the thirty-third degree of latitude. He had\\r\\nascertained, beyond all question, that it emptied its flood into the\\r\\nGulf of Mexico. This important discovery, it was claimed, gave to the\\r\\nFrench, according to the received law of nations, the whole valley of\\r\\nthe Mississippi and its tributaries, however great that valley might\\r\\nprove to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis intelligence was received with every demonstration of public\\r\\nrejoicing. It gave, as it was supposed, to France a new world of\\r\\nboundless resources. The garrison band played its most exultant airs.\\r\\nSalvos of artillery echoed along the majestic cliffs. There was\\r\\nfeasting, dancing, and singing, and the spacious church was thronged\\r\\nwith worshippers praising God with the national anthems of Te Deum.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis great event gave a new impulse and a new direction to the ambition\\r\\nof La Salle. He at once conceived the idea of establishing a series of\\r\\nmilitary and trading posts along the whole length of the lakes, and\\r\\nupon all the important points of the great river and its tributaries.\\r\\nBut even then he was but little aware how magnificent was the realm\\r\\nwhich these tributaries watered. He would thus, however, in the name of\\r\\nthe King of France, take military possession of the whole territory.\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernor Frontenac gave his most cordial approval to the gigantic plan.\\r\\nHis own mind was greatly excited by the thought of the grandeur of a\\r\\nchain of forts extending from the mouth of the St. Lawrence to the Gulf\\r\\nof Mexico. He urged La Salle to go immediately to France, seek an\\r\\naudience with the king, lay the plan before him, and seek the royal\\r\\npatronage. The renowned Colbert was then minister of finance and\\r\\nmarine. The governor furnished La Salle with letters to the minister\\r\\nwhich would secure for him a respectful reception.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle, a penniless adventurer, recrossed the ocean. It was the year\\r\\n1675. His plan at once attracted attention, and he was cordially\\r\\nreceived by both minister and king. The courtiers rallied around him\\r\\nwith much enthusiasm. The king, having honored him with the title of\\r\\nchevalier, authorized him to rebuild, on the shores of Lake Ontario,\\r\\nFort Frontenac, which was falling to decay, and invested him with the\\r\\noffice of seignory or governorship of the fort and its adjacent\\r\\nterritory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sublime plan which La Salle thus proposed, could only be carried\\r\\ninto execution by the continuous labors of many years. La Salle\\r\\nreturned to Canada full of bright dreams for the future. For more than\\r\\ntwo years he was employed in rearing the walls of Fort Frontenac and\\r\\nimproving the region around. This important post occupied a commanding\\r\\nposition near the eastern extremity of Lake Ontario.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the close of the year 1677 he again returned to France, to report\\r\\nthe progress he had made. His reception by the court was even more\\r\\ncordial than before, and he received from the king new honors and more\\r\\nextended privileges. On the 14th of July, 1678, he sailed from Rochelle\\r\\nfor Quebec. He took with him an Italian gentleman, by the name of\\r\\nTonti, as his lieutenant, and a party of thirty men. After a two\\r\\nmonths\\' voyage, they landed at Quebec on the 15th of September. Then,\\r\\npaddling up the swift current of the St. Lawrence, they passed the\\r\\nlittle cluster of log-cabins surrounded with Indian wigwams at\\r\\nMontreal, and after a voyage of between three and four hundred miles\\r\\nreached Fort Frontenac.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was indeed a post far away in the wilderness. It was strongly\\r\\nbuilt, with four bastions on the northern side of the entrance to the\\r\\nlake, at the head of a snug forest-fringed bay, where quite a fleet of\\r\\nsmall vessels could be sheltered from the winds.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a very curious spectacle which was then witnessed upon this\\r\\nremote frontier of civilization. The unbroken wilderness, where wolves\\r\\nhowled and bears roamed, spread in apparently unbroken gloom in all\\r\\ndirections. The fort rose in quite massive proportions, enclosing\\r\\nwithin its palisades a number of cabins, which the garrison occupied,\\r\\nand which were stored with goods suitable for traffic with the natives.\\r\\nThere was a small green meadow spread around, which was covered with\\r\\nwigwams of every picturesque variety. Groups of Indians, of various\\r\\ntribes, were moving about. The warriors were painted and plumed, and\\r\\nmany of them very gorgeously attired. Women, young and graceful girls,\\r\\nand little children, were clustered around the camp fires, some with\\r\\nbusy hands usefully employed; others shouting and sporting in all the\\r\\nvarieties of barbaric pastimes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was an instructive scene, emblematic of this fallen world. The\\r\\nfrowning fort, with its threatening armament, proclaimed that sin had\\r\\nentered the world with its war and blood and misery, making man the\\r\\ndireful foe of his brother man. The crystal stream and lake; the azure\\r\\nof the overarching skies; the bright, serene autumnal day; the foliage,\\r\\nthe verdure, the picturesque wigwams; the peaceful employments of the\\r\\nwomen, and the sports and shouts of the merry children, showed that our\\r\\nruined Eden still retained some of those glories which embellished it\\r\\nbefore man rebelled against his Maker.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle, on his return from Europe, in the autumn of 1678, had brought\\r\\nwith him a select company of sailors, carpenters, and other mechanics.\\r\\nAt Quebec a number of Canadian boatmen joined him. These men he sent\\r\\nforward to Fort Frontenac, which was now virtually his castle, with the\\r\\nsurrounding territory his estate. The boats were heavily laden with all\\r\\narticles for trading with the Indians, and with all the essentials for\\r\\nbuilding and rigging vessels. He soon followed them, in an open birch\\r\\ncanoe, with one or two companions. It was a long and perilous river\\r\\nvoyage, paddling up the swift current of the St. Lawrence between its\\r\\nthousand islands, struggling against its rapids, and seeking for the\\r\\neddies along its lonely forest-fringed shores. Several times they came\\r\\nnear being wrecked, with inevitable death.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the close of the day it was always necessary to run the canoe\\r\\nashore, to land and encamp. But with hardy men, fond of adventure,\\r\\nthese were pleasures rather than pains. With their axes, in half an\\r\\nhour they could construct a sheltering camp. A brilliant fire would\\r\\ndispel all gloom, with its wide-spreading illumination. The fragrant\\r\\ntwigs of the hemlock furnished a soft couch. Here they cooked their\\r\\nsuppers, sang their songs, told their stories, and, free from all care,\\r\\nprobably experienced at least as much pleasure as is usually found in\\r\\nparlors the most sumptuous.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndian villages were quite profusely scattered along the banks of this\\r\\nmajestic river. The scene was often quite exciting as the canoe of the\\r\\nvoyagers approached one of these clusters of picturesque wigwams in the\\r\\nevening twilight. The Indians were fond of the song, and the dance, and\\r\\nthe blaze of the bonfire. The whole expanse of river, cliff, and\\r\\nforest, would be lighted up. Shouts of barbaric revelry echoed through\\r\\nthe sublime solitudes. And the warrior, the squaw, and the pappoose,\\r\\nflitted about in all the varied employments of savage life.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn these Indian wigwams, at night, the voyagers almost invariably found\\r\\nhospitable refuge. The Indians were generally friendly. The traffic\\r\\nwhich the French traders introduced was of inestimable value to the\\r\\npoor savages. And even those who were disposed to look with suspicion\\r\\nupon the encroachments of the white men, were overawed by the\\r\\nthunderings and lightnings of their death-dealing muskets. There were\\r\\nfishes of delicious flavor in the stream, and game in great variety\\r\\nupon the banks. These viands, with the food they took with them,\\r\\nfurnished breakfasts and suppers which they deemed even sumptuous.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fort was reached in safety. On the 18th of November, La Salle sent\\r\\na small vessel of ten tons burden, with a deck, to go to the farther\\r\\nend of Lake Ontario, a distance of about two hundred miles, and to\\r\\nascend the Niagara River until the falls were reached. The vessel\\r\\ncontained about thirty workmen, with provisions and implements for\\r\\nerecting a fort and building a vessel beyond the falls at the extreme\\r\\neastern end of Lake Erie. Having ascended the river as far as possible,\\r\\nthey were to transport their effects along an Indian trail, in the\\r\\nwilderness, several miles above the falls and the rapids, until they\\r\\nreached comparatively still water at the opening of the lake. Here, in\\r\\nmid-winter, they were to construct their fortified magazine, and build\\r\\na vessel for their vast inland tour through almost unknown seas, in\\r\\nsearch of the distant Mississippi.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven then this continent was so little known that many supposed that\\r\\nthe Mississippi emptied into the Pacific Ocean, and that thus the\\r\\nlong-sought-for route to China would be found.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly about ten years before, in the year 1669, La Salle, on an\\r\\nexploring tour with a party of missionaries in birch canoes, had\\r\\ndiscovered these falls. M. Galinee, in his journal of the expedition,\\r\\nwrites:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"We found a river one eighth of a league broad, and extremely\\r\\n    rapid, forming the outlet from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario. The depth\\r\\n    is extraordinary, for we found close to the shore, fifteen or\\r\\n    sixteen fathoms of water. This outlet is forty miles long. It has,\\r\\n    from ten to twelve miles above its embouchure into Lake Ontario,\\r\\n    one of the finest cataracts in the world. All the Indians say that\\r\\n    the river falls from a rock higher than the tallest pines. We heard\\r\\n    the roar at the distance of ten or twelve miles. The fall gives\\r\\n    such momentum to the water, that its current prevented our\\r\\n    ascending, except with great difficulty. The current above the\\r\\n    falls is so rapid, that it often sucks in deer and stags, elk and\\r\\n    roebuck, endeavoring to cross the river, and overwhelms them in its\\r\\n    frightful abyss.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the earliest description of the falls on record. At this time\\r\\nnearly the whole of the present State of New York was a dense, unbroken\\r\\nwilderness. It is very evident, that among the Indians there were, as\\r\\nin every community, good men and bad men. But on the whole, the\\r\\ncondition of humanity among the savages must have been dreadful. What\\r\\nare we to think of a state of society in which every man\\'s reputation\\r\\nand distinction depended upon the number of human scalps, torn from the\\r\\nslain victims by his own hands, with which he could fringe his\\r\\ngarments?\\r\\n\\r\\nOn this tour La Salle visited the Seneca Indians in Western New York,\\r\\nwhere the beautiful cities of civilization and Christianity now adorn\\r\\nthe landscape. Here they witnessed one of the most tragic spectacles of\\r\\nsavage life.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome warriors arrived in one of the villages with a prisoner. He was a\\r\\nfinely formed young man, about nineteen years of age, from the Shawnee\\r\\ntribe residing near the Scioto River. They had clothed their victim for\\r\\nthe sacrifice. Anxious that he should endure the torture as long as\\r\\npossible, they had treated him tenderly, that his bodily strength might\\r\\nnot be weakened. He had been given, according to their custom, to an\\r\\naged Indian woman, in place of her son who had been killed. It was at\\r\\nher option to adopt him or to cause him to be put to death by torture.\\r\\nShe chose the torture.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man was taken into a cabin adjoining that which was occupied\\r\\nby La Salle and Galinee. The two Frenchmen visited him in the evening.\\r\\nThree women were wailing the death of their relative who had been\\r\\nkilled, and were heaping imprecations upon the victim through whose\\r\\ntortures they hoped to avenge the death of the one who had been slain.\\r\\nThe Christians pleaded earnestly for him, and offered large rewards to\\r\\nobtain him as a guide to conduct them to the Ohio. All was in vain.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the earliest dawn of the next morning, a group came rushing into La\\r\\nSalle\\'s cabin to announce that the torture was about to commence. They\\r\\nwent out and found the victim entirely stripped of his clothing, and so\\r\\nbound to a stake that he could move for a distance of two or three\\r\\nfeet. The whole band--men, women, and children--were gathered\\r\\nexultingly around, to enjoy the cruel pastime. The poor boy well knew\\r\\nwhat he had to undergo, for he had probably often assisted in similar\\r\\nscenes.\\r\\n\\r\\nM. Galinee was slightly acquainted with the Algonquin language; he\\r\\ncould hold some conversation with the captive. The victim, pale and\\r\\nterror-stricken, entreated the Frenchmen to intercede for him, that his\\r\\nexecution might be postponed until the next day. Again they renewed\\r\\ntheir efforts to save the boy. They offered to pay a large amount of\\r\\ntheir most valuable effects for his ransom. But the Indians shook their\\r\\nheads and said, \"It is our custom: he must die.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA large fire had been kindled near by. In it there was a long\\r\\ngun-barrel heated to a red heat. An Indian warrior, a staid, sober man,\\r\\ncame forward with much dignity of manner, and taking the red-hot\\r\\ngun-barrel pressed it upon the soles of the victim\\'s feet, and moved it\\r\\nslowly up his legs. The skin and flesh smoked and crackled under the\\r\\nterrible infliction. The agony was such that the poor boy could not\\r\\nrefrain from loud shrieks, and he was thrown into the most convulsive\\r\\ncontortions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe savages--the stern men, the women, the girls, the boys--were\\r\\ndelighted. As they listened to the shrieks and witnessed the agonizing\\r\\nstruggles of their victim, they clapped their hands, and danced and\\r\\nshouted in fiend-like exultation. The heated iron was passed over his\\r\\nwhole body, from the sole of his feet to the crown of his head. There\\r\\nwas not a spot left which was not blistered and roasted. And still they\\r\\ncarefully avoided touching any vital point, that the horrible torture\\r\\nmight be continued as long as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor six hours this poor creature endured every variety of agony which\\r\\ndiabolical ingenuity could inflict. I will not continue the narration.\\r\\nIt is too harrowing to be contemplated. But it is needful to go thus\\r\\nfar to show what the Indians were without the Gospel. Galinee writes:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"At length they knocked him down with a stone, and throwing\\r\\n    themselves upon him, cut his body in pieces. One carried off his\\r\\n    head, another an arm, a third some other member, which they put in\\r\\n    the pot to boil for a feast. Many offered some to the Frenchmen,\\r\\n    telling them there was nothing in the world better to eat; but no\\r\\n    one desired to try the experiment.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"In the evening all assembled in the public place, each with a\\r\\n    stick in his hand, with which they began to beat the cabins on all\\r\\n    sides, making a very loud noise, to chase away, they said, the soul\\r\\n    of the deceased, which might be concealed in some corner to do them\\r\\n    injury.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis scene took place in Western New York, a mile and a half west of\\r\\nBoughton Hill, but about two hundred years ago. Surely the religion of\\r\\nJesus has improved the condition of humanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle and Galinee, unable to endure the spectacle, retired, in\\r\\nanguish of spirit, to their cabin. \"As I was praying to God,\" writes\\r\\nGalinee, \"and very sad, La Salle came and told me that from the\\r\\nexcitement he saw prevailing, he was apprehensive that the Indians\\r\\nmight insult us, and that we had better return to the canoes.\" Hastily\\r\\nthey retired.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut let us return from this digression. La Salle joined his companions\\r\\nat the head of Niagara River, on the borders of Lake Erie, on the 29th\\r\\nof January, 1679. The river, above the falls, was a sheet of ice,\\r\\nresembling a plain paved with fine polished marble. While many of his\\r\\nmen had been employed building a vessel to be launched upon the lake,\\r\\nothers had boldly explored all the surrounding region, purchasing of\\r\\nthe Indians furs and skins. The winter was intensely cold, and the snow\\r\\nwas deep. There was a small cluster of Indian wigwams on the Niagara\\r\\nRiver below the Falls.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indians, men, women and children, received La Salle and his party\\r\\neven affectionately. They took the strangers into their warm cabins,\\r\\nspread bear-skin couches for them, to sleep with their feet toward the\\r\\nfire, and fed them with their daintiest bits of game. White-fish were\\r\\ntaken in great abundance at that place, and were deemed in flavor equal\\r\\nto the golden brook-trout. The floating ice endangered their\\r\\nbrigantine. The Indians aided with infinite labor in dragging it to a\\r\\nsafe place upon the beach, just below those towering cliffs which\\r\\nfringe so large a portion of this wild river. This spot was near the\\r\\npresent site of Queenstown, on the western side of the stream.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the goods were to be transported through a trail of the forest,\\r\\nencumbered with snow, around the falls, a distance of about twenty\\r\\nmiles, on the shoulders of men. The Indians, with fraternal kindness,\\r\\naided in these herculean labors, and were amply repaid for days of\\r\\ntoil, by a knife, a hatchet, or a few trinkets, as valuable to them as\\r\\nare diamonds and pearls to a duchess. La Salle constructed a fortified\\r\\ndÃ©pÃ´t at this place, to serve as a base for future operations. Here he\\r\\ncould store such additional supplies as he might order from Fort\\r\\nFrontenac. Strange as it may seem, it appears that he could leave\\r\\npriceless treasure in a frail log-hut, thus far away in the wilderness,\\r\\nunder the protection of the Indians themselves. And yet these very men\\r\\nand women, had La Salle been captured in battle, would have shouted and\\r\\nleaped for joy in seeing him writhing and shrieking beneath fiend-like\\r\\ntortures. Such is fallen man. He is the ruin of a once noble fabric.\\r\\nBut many fragments of his former grandeur still remain. There is no\\r\\nphilosophy, save the religion of the Bible, which can explain these\\r\\ndiscordances.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 20th of January, 1679, La Salle, with his long train of heavily\\r\\nladen men in single file, reached his large log-cabin and ship-yard in\\r\\nthe midst of a dense forest on the shore of Lake Erie. They brought\\r\\nupon their backs provisions, merchandise, ammunition, and materials for\\r\\nrigging the vessel. The dock-yard--it could hardly be called a\\r\\nfort--was about six miles above Niagara Falls, on the western side of\\r\\nthe river, at the outlet of a little stream called Chippewa Creek.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men there had been employed in erecting their hut, cutting ship\\r\\ntimber, and preparing the ground for building their vessel. There were\\r\\nmany Indians continually visiting them. La Salle, the very week of his\\r\\narrival, laid the keel of his vessel, and with his own hand drove the\\r\\nfirst bolt. He had no thought of encroaching upon the lands of the\\r\\nIndians, or of erecting any forts in antagonism to them. The object of\\r\\nhis expedition was solely to make discoveries in the name of France, to\\r\\nestablish trading stations for the purchase of valuable furs of the\\r\\nIndians, and to erect throughout the region he traversed military\\r\\nposts, over which the banners of France might float, which would prove\\r\\nthat by the right of discovery, the region belonged to France and not\\r\\nto England. The foe to be guarded against was the British Government,\\r\\nnot the Indian tribes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith characteristic sagacity, La Salle summoned a council of the chiefs\\r\\nof all the neighboring tribes, and addressed them in substance as\\r\\nfollows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I come to you as a friend and a brother. I wish to buy your furs. I\\r\\nwill pay you for them in guns and powder, knives, hatchets, kettles,\\r\\nbeads, and such other articles as you want. Thus you can do me good,\\r\\nand I can do you good. We can be brothers. I am building a vessel, that\\r\\nI may visit other tribes, purchase their furs, and carry to them our\\r\\ngoods. Let us smoke the pipe of friendship, and shake hands. The Great\\r\\nSpirit will be pleased to see us, His children, love one another and\\r\\nhelp each other. I wish to establish a trading-post here, where I can\\r\\ncollect my furs, where you can come to sell them. And here you will\\r\\nfind mechanics who will mend your guns, knives, and kettles, when they\\r\\nget out of order.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese were honest words. They were convincing. All smoked the pipe and\\r\\ngrasped hands in token of fraternity. The Frenchman was a benefactor,\\r\\nnot an enemy. His life was to be carefully protected. Should he, from\\r\\nunkind treatment, refuse to come to their country, they could buy no\\r\\nmore guns, or knives, or kettles. Henceforth every wigwam welcomed the\\r\\nentrance of a Frenchman.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle, while engaged in building his vessel, despatched several\\r\\ncanoes along each shore of Lake Erie, to visit every Indian village and\\r\\npurchase their furs. Indian friends paddled the canoes and acted as\\r\\ninterpreters. The arrival of one of these canoes at an Indian village\\r\\nwas an occasion of universal rejoicing. Happy was the chief who could\\r\\nbe honored by entertaining the white trader in his wigwam. The\\r\\nFrenchman was in no more danger in moving about amid their dwellings\\r\\nand forests, than he would have been in traversing the boulevards in\\r\\nParis.\\r\\n\\r\\nA poor Indian would bring in some rich furs, to him scarcely of any\\r\\nvalue, but worth ten dollars in London or Paris. He would receive in\\r\\nexchange a strong, keen-edged pocket-knife, worth in London or Paris\\r\\nperhaps half a dollar, but to him worth ten times ten dollars. He would\\r\\ngo home to his wigwam so happy that he could scarcely sleep. He would\\r\\nshow his almost priceless treasure to his wife, his children, his\\r\\nneighbors. Accustomed to shave down his bow and arrows only with such\\r\\nan edge as a hard stone could afford, he was filled with inexpressible\\r\\ndelight as the keenly cutting steel performed its wondrous work.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young lady of wealthy parents may rejoice when the grand piano\\r\\nfirst enters her father\\'s parlor. The fashionable matron may feel some\\r\\ndegree of exultation as she regards the splendor of her newly furnished\\r\\nreception-room. But their joy was as nothing compared with the delight\\r\\nwith which an Indian woman, for the first time in her life, hung a\\r\\nstout iron kettle over her cabin fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle named his vessel the \"Griffin,\" as that animal was one of the\\r\\nemblems on his family coat-of-arms. During the winter, while the vessel\\r\\nwas on the stocks, circumstances required the presence of La Salle at\\r\\nFort Frontenac. Promptly he set out for a journey on foot of three\\r\\nhundred miles through the snow and the woods. Two men accompanied him.\\r\\nA strong dog dragged a portion of the baggage on a sled. Wherever night\\r\\novertook them they hastily constructed their camp, built their fire,\\r\\ncooked their supper, wrapped themselves in furs, and fell asleep. He\\r\\nseemed to think no more of such a journey than a gentleman does now of\\r\\na trip, in cushioned cars, from Boston to New Orleans. But nothing in\\r\\nthis world ever goes smoothly a long time. In every man\\'s life it may\\r\\nbe said,\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Storm after storm rises dark o\\'er my way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral boats laden with supplies bound from Frontenac to Niagara were\\r\\nlost in tempests on the lake. This caused great embarrassment.\\r\\nProvisions even became scarce. The laborers would have suffered for\\r\\nfood but for the services of Indian hunters who brought in deer and\\r\\nother game. The fur trade was becoming a matter of great importance.\\r\\nThere were many private traders and companies engaged in the traffic,\\r\\nwho were alarmed in view of the magnitude of the operations\\r\\ncontemplated by La Salle, and of the monopoly which had been granted to\\r\\nhim by the king. Here again we see the dark side of human nature. These\\r\\nmen, Frenchmen, nominal Christians, endeavored to rouse the Indians\\r\\nagainst La Salle, even to burnings and massacres. They said to the\\r\\nsavages:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"La Salle wishes to take possession of your whole country. He is\\r\\nbuilding a fort at Niagara, and another at Erie. He is building a large\\r\\nvessel, that he may explore all your distant lakes and large rivers. He\\r\\nwill erect his strong forts upon every commanding spot. These forts he\\r\\nwill garrison with armed men, well provided with muskets, and big guns\\r\\nwhose roar is like that of thunder. Then he will take your lands and\\r\\nbring in white men by thousands, and you will all be killed or driven\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your only safety is in destroying the forts at Niagara and Erie, and\\r\\nin burning the vessel he is building, before it is launched. We will\\r\\nnot trespass on your lands. We will build no forts. We will bring to\\r\\nyour villages, in our canoes, all the goods you want and will buy all\\r\\nyour furs. Thus you will be in no danger.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese plausible representations alarmed the Indians. Some of them\\r\\nvisited the encampment, and with a suspicious eye watched all the\\r\\nmovements. There were two parties formed, the friendly and the\\r\\nunfriendly. La Salle was embarrassed. He might be attacked. His little\\r\\nhandful of men would need a strong fortress for their protection. But\\r\\nto strengthen his works would confirm the fears of his foes and add to\\r\\ntheir number. An Indian woman revealed to him a plot to set fire to his\\r\\nbrigantine on the stocks.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe kept a careful watch, ordered all his men to be secretly ready for a\\r\\nsurprise, and pushed forward the building of the vessel with all vigor.\\r\\nEarly in April the vessel was launched. The sublime Te Deum resounded\\r\\nthrough the solitudes of the forest as thanksgivings were offered to\\r\\nGod for the success of the enterprise thus far. Prayers were breathed\\r\\nforth that God would guide and bless the vessel and its crew. The\\r\\nvessel was moored at a safe distance from the shore. All the men swung\\r\\ntheir hammocks on board their floating fortress, and were quite secure\\r\\nfrom any intrusion of the savages.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The Voyage Along the Lakes_.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Embarcation. Equipment of the Griffin. Voyage through the Lakes and\\r\\nStraits. The Storm. Superstition of the Voyagers. Arrival at Mackinac.\\r\\nScenery there. Friendship of the Indians. Sail on Lakes Huron and\\r\\nMichigan. Arrival at Green Bay. The well-freighted Griffin sent back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 7th of August, 1679, the Griffin spread her sails for her\\r\\nadventurous voyage into the vast unknown. Her armament consisted of\\r\\nfive small cannon, two of which were of brass, and three clumsy guns\\r\\ncalled arquebuses. The vessel was of but sixty tons burden. Most of the\\r\\nmen had muskets for taking game. The current in the river, where the\\r\\nvessel was moored, was very rapid. But by aid of a fair wind, and\\r\\ntwelve men pulling by a rope on the shore, all difficulties were\\r\\novercome, and the Griffin entered triumphantly the broad expanse of\\r\\nLake Erie.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the anchor was raised and the canvas spread, a simultaneous salute\\r\\nwas fired from the five cannon, the three arquebuses, and all the\\r\\nmuskets. Such an uproar was never before heard in those silent wilds.\\r\\nAn immense number of Indians crowded the shore. They gazed with\\r\\nastonishment, awe, and indefinable dread upon the novel spectacle. The\\r\\nwhole company of Frenchmen embarked, being thirty-four in number. None\\r\\nwere left at Erie. But at Niagara, as the magazine at Queenstown was\\r\\ncalled, Father Melethon remained, with one or two laborers, to receive\\r\\nsuch supplies as might be forwarded to that place.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree missionaries accompanied the expedition, Fathers Hennepin,\\r\\nZenobe, and Ribourde. They were venerable and good men, ready at any\\r\\nmoment to lay down their lives in advocacy of the Christian faith. Lake\\r\\nErie is about two hundred and sixty miles long, and from ten to sixty\\r\\nbroad. They ran along the northern shore of this majestic inland sea,\\r\\nand on the third day reached its western bounds, where they cautiously\\r\\nentered the mouth of the strait through which flows the waters of all\\r\\nthe upper lakes. It was about twenty-eight miles long, and one mile\\r\\nbroad. As canoes alone had thus far passed over its surface, it was\\r\\nnecessary for them to feel their way with much care. La Salle gave the\\r\\nstrait the name of Detroit. Soon entering another lake, twenty-four\\r\\nmiles long by thirty broad, he gave it the name of St. Clair, in honor\\r\\nof the saint whose name appears in the calendar of the church for that\\r\\nday.\\r\\n\\r\\nPassing safely over the shallow waters, the Griffin entered another\\r\\nstrait, about thirty miles long, to which La Salle gave the name of St.\\r\\nClair River. The current was strong, and the navigation perilous.\\r\\nGigantic steamers now run through from Lake Erie to Lake Huron in a few\\r\\nhours. It required thirteen days for the Griffin to accomplish the\\r\\npassage. The whole distance is about ninety miles.\\r\\n\\r\\nLake Huron opened magnificently before them. The route along the shore\\r\\nof the lake to its head, where it receives the waters of Michigan and\\r\\nSuperior, is about three hundred and sixty miles. Its greatest breadth\\r\\nis one hundred and sixty miles. The progress of the voyagers was slow.\\r\\nThey were impeded by calms and head winds. It was often necessary to\\r\\ncast the lead and to watch for rocks and sand-bars. They had but just\\r\\nentered upon Lake Huron when they encountered one of the severest\\r\\ntempests which ever swept that stormy lake. The whole ship\\'s company\\r\\nwere devout Catholics.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn those dark days both the fathers and the crew were alike disposed to\\r\\ncall upon the Virgin Mary and the saints to aid them, rather than upon\\r\\nGod. Father Hennepin tells us that the stout soul of La Salle quailed\\r\\nbefore the horrible tumult which threatened to engulf him. They all\\r\\nalike fell upon their knees and addressed their prayers and their cries\\r\\nto St. Anthony of Padua. They solemnly vowed that if he would intercede\\r\\nwith God and obtain their rescue, they would, in the newly-discovered\\r\\ncountries, erect a chapel in his name. St. Anthony was called the\\r\\npatron of mariners, and therefore his aid was especially invoked.\\r\\n\\r\\nGreatly was their confidence in the saint\\'s intercession increased, as\\r\\nthe wind lulled, the clouds dispersed, the sun shone forth in all its\\r\\nautumnal glory, and with a fair wind pressing their sails they glided\\r\\nalong over a smooth sea, skirting the southern shore of the lake, past\\r\\nmountains and valleys, prairies and forest, which presented every\\r\\nvariety of picturesque beauty.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the extreme northwestern extremity of Lake Huron, near the point\\r\\nwhere the lake receives the waters of Lakes Michigan and Superior,\\r\\nthere was a large island, whose swelling hills were crowned with a\\r\\ndense forest. This island was called by the Indians, from its peculiar\\r\\nform, Mackinac, or the Turtle, sometimes Michilimackinac, or the big\\r\\nTurtle. On the 27th of August, 1679, the Griffin ran into a beautiful\\r\\nlittle bay in this island. It was a lovely summer\\'s day, serene, sunny,\\r\\nand cloudless. The waters of the bay, fringed with forest-crowned\\r\\nhills, were as placid as a mirror. There was quite a village there of\\r\\nwigwams. Naked children were sporting upon the beach. Buoyant birch\\r\\ncanoes, driven by the paddles of gayly-dressed men and women, were\\r\\ngliding swiftly in all directions. The scene opened before the eyes of\\r\\nthe voyagers like a vision of enchantment.\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly ten years before, Father Marquette, inspired by apostolic zeal,\\r\\nhad traversed this whole distance in a birch canoe. Several Indians\\r\\naccompanied him as boatmen and interpreters. Upon the main land, across\\r\\na narrow strait, he had established a mission-post among the Hurons.\\r\\nThe Indians at Mackinac thus knew something of the white men. With\\r\\nwonder they gazed upon the \"great wooden canoe.\" They crowded on board\\r\\nthe Griffin with every testimonial of confidence and friendship, and\\r\\nwhen one of the cannon was fired, and its roar reverberated through the\\r\\nforest, they were astonished, but not frightened.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough this remote village seemed so peaceful and happy, the strong\\r\\npalisades which surrounded it proved that the voyagers had not yet got\\r\\nbeyond the vestiges of Adam\\'s fall. Those defences spoke of midnight\\r\\nassaults, of savage yells, of tomahawks, scalps, blood, misery, and\\r\\ndeath. La Salle, aware of the influence of outward appearance upon the\\r\\nminds of men, dressed himself in a very rich scarlet cloak fringed with\\r\\ngold lace. With a plumed military cap upon his head, a long sword at\\r\\nhis side, and an imposing escort of well-dressed and well-armed men, he\\r\\nwas rowed ashore, to make a visit of ceremony to the chief. His\\r\\nreception was as hospitable and friendly as those untutored men were\\r\\ncapable of giving.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle had sent forward several canoes of men, to collect all the\\r\\nfurs they could on their way, and store them at Mackinac. These furs,\\r\\nupon his arrival, La Salle would transfer to the Griffin and send them\\r\\nback to Fort Frontenac, to be thence transported to Europe. But these\\r\\nmen had bitterly disappointed him. Some of them had run away and joined\\r\\nthe Indians, attracted by the apparently careless, easy life which the\\r\\nwigwam presented. Others had been bribed, by higher wages, to join\\r\\nrival trading parties. One of the canoes of deserters had pushed on to\\r\\nthe Falls of St. Mary. These falls, quite renowned in the early\\r\\nexplorations of these remote regions, were situated on the strait which\\r\\nconnects Lake Superior with Huron.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a short tarry at Mackinac, the sails of the Griffin were again\\r\\nspread, and passing through the strait between Mackinac and the main\\r\\nland, they entered the head of Lake Michigan. They coasted along its\\r\\nnorthern border in beautiful summer weather, and within pleasant view\\r\\nof the shore, until they came to an island where there was a pleasant,\\r\\nsheltered cove, at the mouth of Green Bay, a sheet of water which,\\r\\nthrough a broad entrance studded with islands, spread out on the west\\r\\nof Michigan, a hundred miles in length, by about twenty in breadth.\\r\\n\\r\\nA tribe of Indians, called Pottawatomies, inhabited this island. Here\\r\\nit was La Salle\\'s good fortune to find one of his large canoes, well\\r\\nfreighted with furs. He had also laid in a large store at Mackinac. As\\r\\nhe was soon to leave the Griffin, to cross the land by portages, and\\r\\npaddle in birch canoes down distant and unknown rivers, he decided to\\r\\nsend back the Griffin to Erie, with her rich freight of furs. At Erie\\r\\nthey would be carried on men\\'s shoulders around the falls to Niagara,\\r\\nthence reshipped to Frontenac, and thence sent to Europe. He remained\\r\\nat the island a fortnight, freighting his ship. She commenced her\\r\\nreturn voyage with a pilot and five mariners. The value of the cargo\\r\\nwas such as to make La Salle a rich man. Notwithstanding all his\\r\\ndiscouragements, his voyage had thus far been a success. Cheered with\\r\\nhope, he now prepared to resume his adventurous explorations in birch\\r\\ncanoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle, having despatched the richly freighted Griffin from the mouth\\r\\nof Green Bay to his abandoned ship-yard at Erie, resumed his voyage in\\r\\nfour heavily laden birch canoes. The company remaining with him\\r\\nconsisted of seventeen men. His freight consisted of a blacksmith\\'s\\r\\nforge, mechanic tools, household utensils, merchandise, arms, and\\r\\nammunition. A very skilful and intelligent Indian accompanied the party\\r\\nas interpreter and hunter. They paddled down the western shore of Lake\\r\\nMichigan, landing every night to build their camp, kindle their fire,\\r\\nand cook their supper. Immediately upon landing, the Indian, with his\\r\\nmusket on his shoulder, disappeared in the forest, and almost\\r\\ninvariably soon returned with an ample supply of game.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the 19th of September, 1679, when the canoes left the mouth of\\r\\nGreen Bay. The stormy days of autumn were approaching, when these\\r\\nnorthern lakes were often ploughed by fierce gales. The island from\\r\\nwhich they set out was several leagues from the main land. They had no\\r\\nsails. Their boats were propelled only by the paddle. The first night,\\r\\nbefore they reached the main land, dense clouds seemed hurrying through\\r\\nthe skies and thickening over their heads. The wind increased into a\\r\\ngale. The blackened waters of the lake were lashed into foam-crested\\r\\nbillows. The sun went down, and gloomy darkness curtained the sky and\\r\\nenveloped the sea. The spray dashed over them. Occasionally a wave\\r\\nwould break into the canoes. At length they discerned the dim outline\\r\\nof the shore. It was a long sandy beach, with no cove, no indentation,\\r\\ninto which they could run their boats. The surges, driven by the\\r\\nnortheast storm, struck the shore so furiously that it seemed\\r\\nimpossible to effect a landing; and yet every moment they were\\r\\nthreatened with destruction. In the darkness they kept as near together\\r\\nas they could, to help one another in case of disaster. Thus hour after\\r\\nhour passed; as our voyagers, weary, hungry, cold, and drenched,\\r\\nstruggled against the waves. A little after midnight the wind lulled.\\r\\nWatching their opportunity they ran their canoes upon the shore, and\\r\\nleaping into the water, carefully dragged them above the waves. The\\r\\nrain still fell. They unloaded each canoe, and so packed the precious\\r\\ncontents that they could protect them from the rain by covering them\\r\\nwith the canoes turned upside down. With their axes they soon\\r\\nconstructed a frail camp. With the flash of powder they with difficulty\\r\\nkindled a fire, for everything was dripping with moisture, and every\\r\\nlog was soaked.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey threw themselves down to sleep upon the wet ground, and in their\\r\\ndrenched garments, but with, their feet toward roaring fires.\\r\\nAccustomed as they were to exposure, these hardships must have caused\\r\\nsevere suffering. The lurid morning revealed to them but a raging sea\\r\\nand a bleak and barren expanse, where no game could be found. Here, in\\r\\ntheir cheerless camp, they were detained by the wind and the rain four\\r\\ndays. The only game their Indian hunter brought in, was a single\\r\\nporcupine. They found its flesh savory, though it afforded scarcely a\\r\\nmouthful for each man.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe storm at length ceased. Again they launched their fragile canoes,\\r\\nand paddled along the placid waters. Soon another storm arose suddenly,\\r\\nand so severe, that they were glad to take shelter upon the lee side of\\r\\na rocky island. There was no growth of timber with which they could\\r\\nbuild a camp, and scarcely sufficient fuel for a fire. Here, like\\r\\nshipwrecked mariners, they remained for two days, wrapped in their\\r\\nblankets, and huddled for shelter in the cavities of the rocks.\\r\\nMercilessly they were pelted with rain mingled with snow.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut again the clouds were dispelled; the sun shone brightly. The\\r\\nmirrored waves of the lake invited them to its surface. Though sobered\\r\\nby their sufferings, they paddled rapidly along, hoping that a long\\r\\ncalm was to succeed the storm. Their voyage was cheered by one bright\\r\\nand sunny day, when the angry clouds again began to gather to do them\\r\\nbattle. The tempest rose so suddenly that they had no time to seek a\\r\\nharbor, but had to run their canoes through the surf on the shore. All\\r\\nhad to leap into the waves to save the frail boats from being broken on\\r\\nthe stony beach. This, their third landing, was near the point where\\r\\nthe River Milwaukie enters the lake.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had not taken a large supply of provisions with them in their\\r\\ncanoes, for they had hoped to find a supply of game by the way. Nearly\\r\\nall their store of corn and vegetables was now exhausted. Two or three\\r\\nIndians were seen in the distance; but they did not venture to approach\\r\\nso formidable a looking band. Three men were sent, with the calumet of\\r\\npeace, to search for their villages and obtain food. They came to a\\r\\ncluster of deserted wigwams, where the sagacity of their Indian guide\\r\\nshowed them an abundance of corn, concealed from the ravages of wild\\r\\nbeasts, in cells under ground. These honest or politic men took all\\r\\nthey wanted, and left behind them ample payment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening twilight, as the boatmen were gathered around their camp\\r\\nfire, quite a group of Indians was seen cautiously approaching. La\\r\\nSalle advanced to meet them, with the calumet uplifted in his hands. As\\r\\nsoon as the Indians saw this emblem of peace, all their fears were\\r\\ndispelled. They rushed forward like a joyous band of children, singing\\r\\nand dancing. They had been to their wigwams, found the treasures which\\r\\nhad been left there, and their joy was inexpressible. They returned\\r\\nlate in the evening to their homes; but in the morning the grateful\\r\\ncreatures returned, bearing an abundant supply of game and corn. La\\r\\nSalle richly rewarded them.\\r\\n\\r\\nNature seemed in sympathy with these blessings of peace, for the sun,\\r\\nemerging from the clouds, shone down serenely upon these children of a\\r\\ncommon Father, and the weary voyagers, greatly cheered, again launched\\r\\ntheir canoes upon the solitary lake.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus they continued, day after day, paddling along the apparently\\r\\ninterminable journey to the South. They passed the spot where the\\r\\nmajestic city of Chicago now stands. It was two hundred years ago. Not\\r\\neven an Indian wigwam was seen to break the expanded and dreary\\r\\nsolitude. A constant succession of storms was encountered until they\\r\\nreached the foot of the lake. Any one who has witnessed the grandeur\\r\\nwith which the ocean-like billows of Lake Michigan often break upon the\\r\\nwestern shore, will wonder how it was possible for those frail canoes\\r\\nto ride over such surges. Every night it was necessary to land, and\\r\\noften the storm detained them for many hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving reached the foot of the lake, they turned to the eastward. Here\\r\\nthey found a milder clime and more tranquil waters. Deer and wild\\r\\nturkeys were very abundant, and their Indian hunter kept them supplied\\r\\nwith game. The trees were festooned with grape-vines, which were laden\\r\\nwith the richest clusters of the delicious fruit. They found a spot at\\r\\nthe foot of the lake so attractive in its landscape beauty, so\\r\\nabounding in fruit and game, that, weary as they were with their\\r\\narduous voyage, they drew their canoes on shore for a few days of rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe labor of one or two hours constructed a comfortable cabin for the\\r\\naccommodation of all. Fuel was abundant for the cheering camp fire. The\\r\\nlake furnished the choicest fish, and the forest supplied them with\\r\\nvenison and every variety of game. Having feasted upon the most\\r\\ndelicious of hunters\\' fare, they wrapped themselves in their blankets,\\r\\nand enjoyed that rich sleep which is one of the greatest blessings of\\r\\nthe worn and the weary.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoccasined footprints had been seen on the sands of the beach,\\r\\nindicating that there were Indians near. One of the men out hunting at\\r\\na little distance from the camp, came upon a large black bear, which\\r\\nhad climbed a high tree, and was feeding upon the luscious grapes.\\r\\nTaking deliberate aim he sent a bullet through the head of the bear,\\r\\nand the huge animal tumbled lifeless to the ground. It so happened that\\r\\nthere was a large party of Indian hunters not far off, who heard the\\r\\nreport of the gun. It was to them a very unusual sound; for they were\\r\\narmed only with bows and arrows. Carefully concealing themselves, they\\r\\nfollowed the man as he dragged the carcass to the camp. It was evening.\\r\\nA brilliant fire illuminated the whole scene. They examined the\\r\\nencampment, counted the number of men, and saw at some distance on the\\r\\nbeach, piles of precious goods, screened from rain by the canoes which\\r\\nwere turned bottom upward over them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the darkness of the night, two or three of them crept noiselessly to\\r\\nthe unguarded canoes, and stole several articles of value. A wakeful\\r\\neye chanced to catch a glimpse of the shadowy form of an Indian\\r\\nstealing through the forest, and gave the alarm. All sprang to arms. La\\r\\nSalle had, as we have said, an Indian guide and hunter with him, from\\r\\nGreen Bay. The Indian band proved to be from that vicinity. They soon\\r\\nentered into a conference with La Salle\\'s guide. The savages assumed\\r\\ngreat frankness and friendliness. One of the chiefs said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We heard the gun and feared that a party of our enemies was\\r\\napproaching. We crept near your camp to ascertain whether you were\\r\\nfriends or foes. But now that we know that we are among Frenchmen, we\\r\\nare with our brothers. We love Frenchmen, and wish to smoke with them\\r\\nthe pipe of peace.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle was cautious. He replied, \"Let four of your men, and four\\r\\nonly, come in the morning to our camp.\" In the meantime he kept a\\r\\ncareful watch. Four venerable men came in the morning, smoked their\\r\\npipes and proffered friendship. Mutual pledges were exchanged, and they\\r\\ndeparted. It was not until after they had left, that the discovery was\\r\\nmade that several valuable articles had been stolen. This entirely\\r\\nchanged the aspect of affairs. La Salle, as energetic as he was\\r\\nconciliatory, resolved to have satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nFearing that if the affront were unavenged he would be exposed to new\\r\\ninsults, he took several well-armed men, penetrated the woods and\\r\\ncaptured two Indians. Having led them as prisoners to his camp, he\\r\\nliberated one, and sent him to the chiefs of the band to say, that if\\r\\nthe stolen goods were not immediately restored, the other captive would\\r\\nbe put to death.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indians, who seemed to have set a high value upon life, were\\r\\nappalled. They could not restore the goods. Many of them had been\\r\\ndestroyed. The chiefs returned this reply. As the Indians greatly\\r\\noutnumbered the Frenchmen, they resolved to attempt to rescue the\\r\\ncaptive by force. In strong military array they advanced to the attack.\\r\\nLa Salle marshalled his little force upon a mound, surrounded by a\\r\\nsandy plain, where there was neither tree, rock, nor shrub, to protect\\r\\nthe assailants. The bullet could be thrown much farther than the arrow.\\r\\nThe hostile forces stood gazing at each other for some time. The chiefs\\r\\nsaw that an attack was hopeless, and that advance was certain death. La\\r\\nSalle had no wish to redden his hands with their blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this emergence Father Hennepin in the peaceful garb of a priest went\\r\\nforward with the Indian interpreter and solicited a conference. Two old\\r\\nmen advanced to meet him. With unexpected intelligence they proposed\\r\\nthat the goods which could be restored, should be sent back, and that\\r\\nthe rest should be amply paid for. This brought peace. Rich presents\\r\\nwere interchanged, the Indians giving several beaver-skin robes. There\\r\\nwere feasting and dancing and speech-making. All hearts were happy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain the canoes were put afloat. Coasting up the eastern shore of the\\r\\nlake fifty or sixty miles they reached the mouth of St. Joseph\\'s River,\\r\\nthen called the River of the Miamis. This is the second river in\\r\\nimportance in the State of Michigan. It has a good harbor at its mouth,\\r\\nflows through an expanse of two hundred and fifty miles, and affords\\r\\nboat navigation for a distance of one hundred and thirty miles. Here\\r\\nthe weary travellers found a port, after a voyage of forty days from\\r\\nGreen Bay.\\r\\n\\r\\nGloomy clouds of trouble now darkened around. His men, weary of their\\r\\nhardships, became mutinous. They remonstrated against continuing their\\r\\njourney into the depths of the unexplored wilderness, peopled by they\\r\\nknew not what hostile tribes. La Salle had ordered Lieutenant Tonti,\\r\\nwith twenty men, to cross the head of the lake and meet him at that\\r\\npoint by a much shorter route. The lieutenant had not arrived. It was\\r\\nfeared that he was lost. At length he came. But he brought no tidings\\r\\nof the Griffin. Two months had elapsed since that vessel sailed from\\r\\nGreen Bay. Her orders were, after discharging her freight at Niagara,\\r\\nto return immediately to St. Joseph\\'s, for another cargo of furs. La\\r\\nSalle had embarked more than all his fortune in that vessel. There was\\r\\nno insurance in those days. He was deeply in debt to the traders in\\r\\nQuebec and Montreal.\\r\\n\\r\\nFearful were his apprehensions that the vessel was lost. If so he was\\r\\nruined, a hopeless bankrupt. The vessel was lost. No tidings of her\\r\\never reached any human ears. In some dreadful tragedy, witnessed only\\r\\nby God, the vessel and its crew sunk in the depths of the waters. While\\r\\nthus harassed with anxiety, the cold blasts of approaching winter swept\\r\\nthe bleak plains. The rivers would soon be closed with ice. His\\r\\nprovisions were exhausted, so that his party was entirely dependent for\\r\\nfood upon such game as could be taken. Under these adverse\\r\\ncircumstances the resolution of this indomitable man remained unshaken.\\r\\nGathering his murmuring companions around him, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have set out to explore the Mississippi. If you abandon me I cannot\\r\\nproceed. But I shall remain here with the missionaries. You may find\\r\\nyour way back as you can, or disperse through the forest as you\\r\\nplease.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men continued to murmur. But for their own protection they worked\\r\\ndiligently upon the fort. From this point La Salle intended to\\r\\nestablish communication with his depot at Niagara. The boatmen also,\\r\\nwho were earnestly devoted to the ritualism of the church, under the\\r\\ndirection of the missionaries built a log chapel, where religious\\r\\nservices were daily held. A numerous tribe of Indians, the Miamis, but\\r\\nto which the missionaries gave the name of St. Joseph\\'s band, had a\\r\\nflourishing village here. There were very friendly. From the fine boat\\r\\nharbor they could fish upon the lake, or, in pursuit of game, could\\r\\npaddle hundreds of miles up the forest-crowned river and its numerous\\r\\ntributaries. Day after day La Salle watched the horizon of the lake,\\r\\nhoping to catch a glimpse of the sails of the returning Griffin,\\r\\nbringing him supplies, and the tidings that his precious furs were safe\\r\\nand his fortune secure. Night after night he placed his head upon his\\r\\npillow, the victim of that hope deferred which maketh the heart sick.\\r\\n\\r\\nThirty-three days of anxiety and toil thus passed away. The boatmen,\\r\\nwho had come with Lieutenant Tonti, increased his number to over thirty\\r\\nmen. At the point of land where the river entered the lake, there was a\\r\\nbluff, of considerable elevation and of triangular form, containing an\\r\\nacre or more of pretty level land. It was at that time covered with\\r\\ntrees. This commanding position was chosen for the fort. Two sides were\\r\\nbounded by water. On the third or land side of the triangle there was a\\r\\ndeep ravine. A breastwork of hewn logs was raised several feet high,\\r\\nenclosing a space eighty feet long by forty feet broad. And this all\\r\\nwas surrounded by stout palisades.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fortress was artistically constructed, and could bid defiance to\\r\\nany attack by the Indians. It was also admirably selected to give the\\r\\nFrench command of the region, against any encroachments of the English.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough the whole month of November the men toiled upon these works,\\r\\nfed only upon the flesh of turkeys, deer, and bears, which their Indian\\r\\nhunter brought in. It was learned that the Griffin, which, it will be\\r\\nremembered, sailed from Green Bay, bound first to Mackinac, did not\\r\\nreach that port. The vessel must have foundered somewhere by the way.\\r\\nThe natives on the coast had heard nothing of the vessel. Seventy days\\r\\nhad now elapsed since she sailed, and all hopes of ever hearing from\\r\\nher again were relinquished.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 3d of December the whole party of thirty-three persons, in eight\\r\\ncanoes, left Fort Miami, as La Salle called his works, and paddled up\\r\\nthe river, a distance of seventy miles, toward the south. Considerable\\r\\ntime was lost in the endeavor to find the trail or portage which led\\r\\nacross, westerly from the St. Joseph\\'s River, to the head waters of the\\r\\nKankakee, which is the eastern branch of the Illinois River.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle, imprudently exploring alone, became lost in the forest. The\\r\\ndarkness of a stormy night, with falling snow, overtook him. He fired\\r\\nhis gun as a signal of distress; but silence was the only answer. Soon\\r\\nhe espied, in the distance, the light of a fire. It was the encampment\\r\\nof a solitary Indian, who had formed for himself a soft bed of leaves.\\r\\nAlarmed by the report of the gun, he had fled. La Salle appropriated to\\r\\nhimself the cheerless quarters and slept soundly until morning. All the\\r\\nforenoon of the next day he wandered, and it was not until the\\r\\nafternoon that he rejoined his companions. He came in with two opossums\\r\\nhanging at his belt, which he had killed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length their Indian hunter found the trail. They had gone too far up\\r\\nthe river. The men took the canoes and the freight upon their\\r\\nshoulders, and carried them over the portage, of five or six miles,\\r\\nwhich the Indians had traversed for countless ages. Dreary in the\\r\\nextreme was the wintry landscape which now opened before them. The\\r\\nground was frozen hard. Ice fringed the stream, and the flat marshy\\r\\nexpanse was whitened with snow. For nearly a hundred miles the sluggish\\r\\nKankakee flowed through a morass, which afforded growth to but little\\r\\nmore than rushes and alders. Their provisions were nearly exhausted. No\\r\\ngame could be found. They were hungry. Each night they landed, built\\r\\ntheir fires, and with scarcely any shelter wrapped themselves in their\\r\\nblankets for almost comfortless sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length the river emerged from these dreary marshes and entered upon\\r\\na large undulating prairie, treeless, but whose fertility was attested\\r\\nby the tall, yet withered grass. The scene became far more cheering.\\r\\nThough most of the herds, which in summer grazed these rich fields, had\\r\\nwandered far away to the south, their indefatigable hunter succeeded in\\r\\nshooting two deer and a stray buffalo, which was found mired. He also\\r\\ntook several fat turkeys and swans.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, with revived spirits, the party, having paddled three hundred\\r\\nmiles down the infinite windings of the Kankakee, entered the more\\r\\nmajestic and beautiful river Illinois. The length of the stream from\\r\\nthis point to its entrance into the Mississippi is two hundred and\\r\\nsixty miles, exclusive of its windings. As they were swept down by the\\r\\ncurrent, they came to a large Indian village on the right bank of the\\r\\nriver, near the present town of Ottawa. There were four or five hundred\\r\\ncabins, very substantially built, and covered with thick mats very\\r\\ningeniously woven from rushes. Extensive corn-fields were near the\\r\\nvillage, but the harvest had been gathered in.\\r\\n\\r\\nSilence and solitude reigned there. Not a living being was to be seen.\\r\\nThe inhabitants had all migrated, according to their custom, to spend\\r\\nthe winter in more southern hunting-grounds. Large quantities of corn\\r\\nwere stored away for summer use in dry cellars. La Salle removed fifty\\r\\nbushels to his canoes, hoping to find the owners farther south and\\r\\namply repay them. It would have been of no avail to have left payment,\\r\\nfor it would be carried away by any band of Indians who chanced to be\\r\\npassing by. The hunger of his men, in his judgment rendered the taking\\r\\nof the corn a necessity. This spot was probably near the site of Rock\\r\\nFort, in La Salle county, Illinois.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor four days they continued their course without coming in sight of\\r\\nany human being or any habitation. Yet they passed through scenery\\r\\noften very charming, presenting a wide-spread ocean of undulating land,\\r\\nwith groves and lawns and parks smiling so peacefully in the bright\\r\\nsunshine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe morning of the 1st of January, 1680, came. All gathered around the\\r\\nmissionaries to commemorate the opening of the new year by religious\\r\\nservices. Prayers were offered, hymns were chanted, sins were\\r\\nconfessed, and the blessing of God was invoked upon their enterprise.\\r\\nAt the conclusion of these devotions the canoes were again pushed out\\r\\ninto the stream. On the fourth of the month they entered an expansion\\r\\nof the river where the breadth of water assumed the dimension of a\\r\\nlake. This sheet of water, now called Peoria Lake, was twenty miles\\r\\nlong and three broad.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt its foot they came upon a very large Indian encampment. La Salle\\r\\npresented the calumet of peace, and fraternal relations were immediately\\r\\nestablished. At this point he decided to build a large boat to sail\\r\\ndown the river. The loss of the Griffin, thus depriving him of his\\r\\nsupplies, had frustrated all his plans. He built a strong fort, which\\r\\nhe called, from his own grief, \"CrÃ¨vecoeur,\" or the Broken Hearted.\\r\\nHere this extraordinary man left most of his company, and with five\\r\\nmen, in mid-winter, set out to cross the pathless wilderness on foot,\\r\\na distance of twelve hundred miles, along the southern shores of Erie\\r\\nand Ontario to Fort Frontenac. The wonderful journey, through storms\\r\\nof snow and rain, across bleak plains and morasses and unbridged rivers,\\r\\nwas safely accomplished in about seventy days. He obtained the needful\\r\\nsupplies, freighted several canoes, engaged new voyagers, and after\\r\\ninnumerable perils again reached the head waters of the Illinois. Here\\r\\nhe learned that his garrison at CrÃ¨vecoeur was dispersed and the\\r\\nfort destroyed. This ended his hopes. He went back to Frontenac a\\r\\ndisappointed but indomitable man, and the enterprise was for the time\\r\\nrelinquished.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere we must leave La Salle for a time, while we give an account of the\\r\\nexpedition from CrÃ¨vecoeur, up the Mississippi, and of the destruction\\r\\nof the colony.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The Expedition of Father Hennepin._\\r\\n\\r\\nSeeking a Northwest Passage. The Voyage Commenced. The Alarm.\\r\\nDelightful Scenery. The Indian Village. Entrance to the Mississippi.\\r\\nAppearance of the Country. The Midnight Storm. Silence and Solitude. A\\r\\nFleet of Canoes. Captured by the Savages. Merciful Captivity. Alarming\\r\\nDebate. Condition of the Captives.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo days before La Salle set out from CrÃ¨vecoeur, on his adventurous\\r\\njourney, through the wilderness, to Fort Frontenac, he despatched\\r\\nFather Louis Hennepin to explore the Mississippi River from the mouth\\r\\nof the Illinois to its source. So little was then known of this\\r\\ncontinent that La Salle had strong hopes that near the source of the\\r\\nMississippi, another stream might be found, flowing toward the west,\\r\\nwhich, by a short voyage, would conduct one to the Pacific Ocean. In\\r\\nthis way he hoped that the long-sought-for northwest passage to the\\r\\nPacific might be discovered.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the morning of the 29th of February, 1680, Father Hennepin, with but\\r\\ntwo companions, entered his birch canoe, to prosecute his grand and\\r\\nperilous enterprise. They were to explore unknown realms, crowded with\\r\\nsavage tribes. They had their guns, not for attack or defence, but for\\r\\ntaking game, with a good supply of ammunition, and with several hundred\\r\\ndollars worth of goods, to conciliate the savages by presents, and to\\r\\nexchange with them for provisions.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the early dawn they commenced their voyage. The day was fine, the\\r\\nriver placid in its gentle flow, and the scenery, on both sides of the\\r\\nstream, of undulating hills, majestic forests, and wide-spread\\r\\nprairies, upon which herds of wild cattle were grazing, was picturesque\\r\\nand alluring in the extreme. As they rapidly descended the river, they\\r\\nmet several parties of Illinois Indians, returning to their village at\\r\\nthe head of the lake. Their canoes were laden with the game they had\\r\\ntaken. The Frenchmen and the Indians exchanged friendly greetings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe kind-hearted savages endeavored to dissuade them from their\\r\\nperilous voyage, assuring them, with all the wildest exaggerations of\\r\\nIndian superstition, that they would encounter birds as large as\\r\\nbuffaloes, who would carry them in their talons as an eagle seizes a\\r\\nrabbit; that there were enormous beasts in the river, doubtless\\r\\nreferring to the alligators, who would dash their canoe to pieces, and\\r\\ndevour a man at a mouthful; then there were rapids and whirlpools from\\r\\nwhich they could not escape, and in which they would be surely\\r\\nengulfed; and that if by any possibility they escaped, all these\\r\\nperils, they would fall into the hands of ferocious tribes, who would\\r\\nenslave them, torture them, cook them, and eat them. They entreated the\\r\\nFrenchmen to go back with them to their village, where they could live\\r\\nin safety and in abundance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two boatmen, Anthony Auguelle and Michael Ako, were alarmed by\\r\\nthese representations, and were strongly inclined to return. But Father\\r\\nHennepin constrained them to press onward. As they descended the\\r\\nIllinois, they found the river deep and broad, much resembling the\\r\\nSeine at Paris. It would, at times, expand to nearly a mile in breadth.\\r\\nLarge trees crowned many of the gentle eminences which lined the\\r\\nstream. Upon ascending the hills, as they landed for their night\\'s\\r\\nencampment, they gazed, with delight in the gorgeous sunset, upon the\\r\\nmagnificent prairies spread out before them as far as the eye could\\r\\nreach.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is nothing which earth has ever presented more beautiful than\\r\\nthose Eden-like landscape resembling the ocean in expanse, which were\\r\\nthus for the first time, unveiled to the view of civilized men. Here\\r\\nand there groups of trees appeared, in small groves, as if planted by\\r\\nthe exquisite taste of a landscape gardener. Herds of buffaloes,\\r\\nantelopes, and deer, grazed the herbage in countless numbers. Birds of\\r\\nevery variety of song and plumage found here their paradise. And in\\r\\nthese fair realms the children of Adam might have experienced joys\\r\\nhardly surpassed by those of their first parents in Eden, were it not\\r\\nfor that inhumanity of man to man which has caused countless millions\\r\\nto mourn. To redeem this world from the curse of sin, Jesus the Son of\\r\\nGod has suffered and died. And there can be no possible true happiness\\r\\nfor the human family until the result of his mission shall be\\r\\naccomplished.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur voyagers, on the seventh day of their journey, having passed down\\r\\nthe windings of the river, about two hundred miles, as they judged,\\r\\ncame to a pleasant Indian village of about two hundred wigwams. These\\r\\nIndians had an eye for beauty. Their little cluster of homes was\\r\\npicturesquely situated upon a green plain, gently ascending from the\\r\\nbanks of the river, which commanded a view of the water for some\\r\\ndistance above and below. The prairie, in its grandeur, spread far and\\r\\nwide around. The village was about six miles above the entrance of the\\r\\nIllinois into the Mississippi River. The tribe was called the Maraos.\\r\\nThe hospitable savages, who without any difficulty could have killed\\r\\nthe Frenchmen and have taken possession of all their goods, treated the\\r\\nstrangers as brothers, and urged them to visit their houses. In these\\r\\nhospitable rites we see beautiful vestiges of the character of man\\r\\nbefore the fall. But alas! we can never meet the children of Adam\\r\\nanywhere, or under any circumstances, without soon seeing the evidence\\r\\nof that fall when sin entered Eden,\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Earth felt the wound; and nature from her seat,\\r\\n    Sighing through all her works, gave signs of woe\\r\\n    That all was lost.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey heard fearful accounts of attacks by ferocious tribes rushing down\\r\\nupon them, plundering, burning, killing, scalping, with mercilessness\\r\\nwhich demons could not exceed. They were expecting soon another attack,\\r\\nand were then upon the point of abandoning their homes and emigrating\\r\\nto the other side of the Mississippi, to join, for their protection,\\r\\nanother large and friendly tribe.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after Father Hennepin resumed his voyage, the Indians, according\\r\\nto his narrative, had their suspicions excited that he was conveying\\r\\nhatchets and guns to their enemies, either intentionally, or which\\r\\nmight fall into their hands. They therefore sent a band of their\\r\\nswift-footed warriors down the river, to a narrow pass, to intercept\\r\\nthe canoe. This could hardly be considered contrary to the laws of\\r\\nwarfare among civilized nations. The Indians had witnessed the\\r\\nlightnings and thunders of the white man\\'s guns, and the terrible\\r\\nenergies of their death dealing-bolts. They might surely consider the\\r\\ncanoe as freighted with goods which were contraband of war.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe know not what reason Father Hennepin had for suspecting this\\r\\nmovement of the Indians. He gives no proof of any such hostile design.\\r\\nIt is not improbable that his suspicions were groundless. As he\\r\\napproached the narrow pass where he imagined the warriors to lie in\\r\\nambush, he saw the smoke of the camp fires ascending from a grove which\\r\\ncrowned one of the eminences. This certainly did not indicate any\\r\\nsecret movement. He paddled close to the other side of the river, not\\r\\nonly without being attacked, but without obtaining even a glimpse of\\r\\nhis imagined foes.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 8th of March they reached the Mississippi River. The broad\\r\\nflood, a mile in width, swept majestically along, from unknown regions\\r\\nof the north, quite covered with floating ice. The vast masses, two or\\r\\nthree feet in thickness, and which could not be eluded, would speedily\\r\\ntear their frail birch canoe into fragments. At the mouth of the\\r\\nIllinois there was a gentle elevation, covered with the stately forest,\\r\\nwhich commanded a fine view of both of the rivers and of the adjacent\\r\\nregion.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the Frenchmen drew their canoe upon the shore, erected a camp,\\r\\nwith open front, as a shelter from the cold north wind, built their\\r\\nfire, cooked their game, of which they found abundance all around, and\\r\\nwaited patiently, four days, for the ice to run by.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the middle of the Mississippi River, nearly opposite the mouth of\\r\\nthe Illinois, there were three small islands, covered with large trees\\r\\nand a dense, tangled growth of brush and vines. The heads of these\\r\\nislands were clogged, for a long distance up the river, with the\\r\\ndeformity of immense rafts of drift logs, stumps, and trees. They\\r\\npresented an exceedingly dreary aspect, swept by the freezing winds,\\r\\nwith truly arctic masses of ice grinding by, and often ploughed up into\\r\\ngreat hillocks upon the sand-bars.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a short distance back from the river a range of hills or bluffs was\\r\\nseen. Between the bluffs and the river the meadow or bottom lands were\\r\\noften treeless, and evidently fertile in the highest degree. On the\\r\\nmorning of the 12th of March the Mississippi was sufficiently clear of\\r\\nice for these intrepid voyagers to venture to launch their canoe upon\\r\\nits surface. Slowly and cautiously they paddled up the stream, keeping\\r\\nnear the shore and taking advantage of every eddy which could be found.\\r\\nThrough vistas opening between the hills and woods occasional glimpses\\r\\nwere caught of prairie regions beyond, whose solitude and silence were\\r\\nonly relieved by the spectacle of grazing herds, and thousands of birds\\r\\nupon the wing. There were no signs of human life. Apparently eternal\\r\\nsilence reigned over those Eden-like solitudes, disturbed only by the\\r\\nlowing of the herds and the varied notes of bird songs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they continued their voyage they came upon many islands, whose thick\\r\\ngrowth of forest trees was so interlaced with vines and undergrowth as\\r\\nto render them almost impenetrable. Vigorously they plied their\\r\\npaddles, day after day, breasting the strong current of the river,\\r\\nencountering no incident of importance. Every night they landed, drew\\r\\ntheir canoe upon the grass, turned it over, so as to cover its contents\\r\\nfrom the rain and the dew, built their frail shelter for the night,\\r\\nkindled their camp fire, whose flame is ever as companionable as it is\\r\\ncheerful, cooked their supper, which they ate with the appetite and\\r\\nzest which labor gives, and then, having offered their vesper prayers\\r\\nand chanted their evening hymn, enjoyed that sweet sleep which is one\\r\\nof the greatest of all earthly blessings. At noon they always had a\\r\\nshort religious exercise in their canoe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey often had mild and beautiful mornings, when the whole wide-spread\\r\\nscene of crystal waters, forest, and prairie seemed illumined with\\r\\nalmost celestial radiance. Bird songs filled the air. The prairies\\r\\nseemed crowded with all the varieties of animal life in peaceful\\r\\nenjoyment. No sights of violence or suffering met the eye. No\\r\\ndiscordant sound fell upon the ear. All was beauty, harmony, and joy.\\r\\nThe landscape resembled our imaginings of the world before the fall,\\r\\nwhen it came fresh from its Maker\\'s hands, and all the morning stars\\r\\nhailed its birth.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut again clouds, like marshalling armies, hurried through and darkened\\r\\nthe sky. The tempest rose with its dirge-like wailing. The surface of\\r\\nthe river was lashed into surges which threatened to devour them. The\\r\\nrain drenched them. The sleet cut their faces. Hastily they sought the\\r\\nshores. Frequently they had to paddle a great distance along the\\r\\nprecipitous banks before they could find any place where they could\\r\\nland. Reaching at length the shore, they first covered their goods with\\r\\nthe upturned canoe.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack night would already envelop them. Groping through the darkness,\\r\\ndrenched with rain, and numbed with sleet, they would, with great\\r\\ndifficulty, raise some frail protection against the storm. No fire\\r\\ncould be kindled. No change of clothing was possible. Throwing\\r\\nthemselves upon the wet sod, hungry, shivering, and sleepless, they\\r\\nwould anxiously await the dawn. The cry of the lone night-bird, and the\\r\\nhowling of wolves, would be added to the discord of the angry elements.\\r\\nIn such hours this globe did indeed seem to be a sin-blighted world,\\r\\nupon which had fallen the frown of its Maker.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmid such changes and toils as these, Father Hennepin and his\\r\\ncompanions, in their frail birch canoe, paddled along against the\\r\\nstrong current of the Mississippi. They breakfasted with the earliest\\r\\ndawn, and continued their voyage through ever-varying scenes of\\r\\nsublimity and beauty, until late in the afternoon. Then they began to\\r\\nlook eagerly for some sheltered nook suitable for their night\\'s\\r\\nencampment. The silence and solitude through which they passed, at\\r\\ntimes seemed pleasing, and again almost awful.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor weary leagues, not a village, not a wigwam, not a solitary Indian,\\r\\nappeared. They seemed to be exploring an uninhabited world. The mouths\\r\\nof many rivers were passed, whose names were unknown to them. With\\r\\nfeelings akin to awe, they looked up the long reaches of streams, now\\r\\nknown by the names of the Des Moines, the Iowa, the Rock River, and the\\r\\nWisconsin. They wondered what scenes were transpiring far away upon the\\r\\nbanks of these apparently solitary waters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had ascended the Mississippi several hundred miles, when, about\\r\\ntwo o\\'clock in the afternoon of the 11th of April, they were startled\\r\\nby seeing suddenly coming round a near headland, thirty large bark\\r\\ncanoes, crowded with Indians, plumed, painted, and armed for battle. It\\r\\nwas a gorgeous as well as an appalling spectacle. The blades of their\\r\\npaddles sparkled in the sunlight. The savages were dressed in the\\r\\nhighest style of barbaric splendor. Their brilliantly colored feathers,\\r\\nfringed garments, and highly decorated bows, war-clubs and javelins,\\r\\nsurpassed, in picturesque beauty, any of the ordinary military trapping\\r\\nof civilized life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moment the savages caught sight of the Frenchmen\\'s boat, they\\r\\nsimultaneously raised a shout or yell, which reverberated along the\\r\\nbanks of the river and struck the hearts of the voyagers with dread.\\r\\nEscape was impossible. Resistance was not to be thought of. The little\\r\\nfleet of canoes, descending the river by the aid both of the current\\r\\nand their paddles, approached with great rapidity. Father Hennepin\\r\\nstood up in his boat and in his hands extended toward the savages, the\\r\\ncalumet of peace. Speedily he was surrounded, the calumet was snatched\\r\\nfrom him, and his canoe was taken to the shore, while all the others\\r\\nfollowed. During all the time the savages were raising frightful cries\\r\\nand yells, the signification of which, whether welcoming or\\r\\nthreatening, could not be understood. It was probably near the mouth of\\r\\nthe Wisconsin River that this capture took place.\\r\\n\\r\\nFather Hennepin had been so long among the Indians, visiting various\\r\\ntribes, and had so long been accustomed to contemplate his violent\\r\\ndeath as an event which might any day take place, that he was far more\\r\\ntranquil in mind than most persons could have been under these\\r\\ncircumstances. Speedily his well-trained eye recognized the chief of\\r\\nthe savages. He presented him some tobacco, and then endeavored by\\r\\nsigns to enter into conversation with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two head chiefs conferred together. They declined smoking the peace\\r\\ncalumet, and were by no means cordial in their reception of the\\r\\nstrangers. There was evidently a diversity of opinion among them, as to\\r\\nthe disposition they should make of their captives. Three blows of the\\r\\ntomahawk would silence them all in death. Their bodies could be thrown\\r\\ninto the stream, and their canoe, with all its freight, of such\\r\\npriceless value to the savages, would be in their possession. Probably\\r\\nsome of them had visited the French forts, and knew how to use the\\r\\nmusket, and appreciated its death-dealing power. Already they had\\r\\nexamined every article in the canoe. They had inspected the rifles, and\\r\\ncounted the store of bullets and powder. Such an acquisition would aid\\r\\nthem inestimably in the war-path upon which they had entered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young men clamored for this decision of the question. In the mind\\r\\nof an untutored savage, who has never enjoyed the light of revealed\\r\\nreligion, the dividing line between right and wrong must necessarily be\\r\\nfaint. With these men, the pride of life consisted in the numbers of\\r\\nenemies they had slain. Inspired by this desire, they were now on the\\r\\nway to attack a neighboring tribe, to burn their homes, destroy their\\r\\nproperty, kill and scalp men, women, and children, and to take back\\r\\nsome of the leading warriors, that they, their wives, and their\\r\\nchildren might enjoy the delight of seeing them put to death by\\r\\ndiabolical torture. Why should they hesitate to tomahawk three white\\r\\nmen who had crossed their path? Why not rob and murder them, when by\\r\\ndoing so they could acquire possessions of the greatest value?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut God seems to have implanted in every human heart some sense of\\r\\nright and wrong, some conviction of responsibility to a Superior Being.\\r\\nSo far as Father Hennepin could understand their sign language, the\\r\\nchiefs informed him that they were going down the Mississippi to attack\\r\\na village of the Miamis on the Illinois River. The war party consisted\\r\\nof but one hundred and twenty braves. They intended to attack the\\r\\nvillage by surprise at night. In an hour they would accomplish their\\r\\nfiend-like deed of murder, scalping, and conflagration. Then, with\\r\\ntheir gory trophies and their prisoners, they would take to their boats\\r\\nand be far away up the river before there could be any rallying of the\\r\\ntribes in pursuit.\\r\\n\\r\\nFather Hennepin told them that the Miamis had been informed of their\\r\\nintended attack; that they had abandoned their village, had fled across\\r\\nthe Mississippi, and having joined another powerful tribe were watching\\r\\nfor their approach. The savages on the shore surrounded their captives,\\r\\nand for some unknown reason frequently gave simultaneous utterance to\\r\\nthe most unearthly yells.\\r\\n\\r\\nFather Hennepin affected great composure, assuming that he was among\\r\\nfriends. He presented to the chiefs two large fat turkeys which he had\\r\\nshot coming up the river. Then, with his two companions, he built a\\r\\nfire, hung his iron kettle, and commenced boiling some venison. The\\r\\nIndians looked quietly on for a few minutes, and then all gathered in a\\r\\ngroup to hold a council. Father Hennepin secretly watched their\\r\\nproceedings with the utmost anxiety. Their speeches were accompanied\\r\\nwith very much action. The debate was prolonged and vehement. He\\r\\nsufficiently understood the language of signs to perceive that they\\r\\nwere divided in opinion, that while a part were in favor of putting\\r\\nthem to death, others were urging that their lives should be spared.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith one of his men he went to the canoe, took six axes, fifteen\\r\\nknives, and a quantity of tobacco, and advancing into the midst of the\\r\\ncouncil presented them to the chiefs. He then took an axe, and bowing\\r\\nhis head, made signs that the Indians might kill him if they wished to\\r\\ndo so. This chivalric deed touched whatever there was of chivalry in\\r\\nthe savage bosom. There was a general murmur of applause. Some of them\\r\\nhad been roasting, at a fire near by, some beaver\\'s flesh. One of the\\r\\nsavages ran, cut a piece of the smoking meat, and bringing it, on a\\r\\nplate of birch bark, with a sharpened stick for a fork, put three\\r\\nmorsels into the mouth of Father Hennepin and his companions. As the\\r\\nfood was very hot, the savage blew upon it to cool it. He then set the\\r\\nplate before them, to eat at their pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill there was a degree of restraint on the part of the Indians, which\\r\\nindicated that there was by no means perfect reconciliation. There was\\r\\nmuch talking apart, and it was evident that the fate of the prisoners\\r\\nwas not yet decided. The representations, however, which Father\\r\\nHennepin had made, induced them to relinquish their contemplated\\r\\nenterprise, and to turn back from the war-path upon which they had\\r\\nentered. Just before night, one of the chiefs silently returned to\\r\\nFather Hennepin his peace calumet. This greatly increased their\\r\\nanxiety, as it was inferred that it was an act renouncing friendship.\\r\\n\\r\\nSavages and Frenchmen all slept alike on the ground and in the open\\r\\nair, by the side of their camp fires. There was no watch kept, and the\\r\\ncaptives had no indication that they were abridged of their freedom.\\r\\nStill they had many fears that they were to be assassinated before the\\r\\nmorning. The two boatmen, Auguelle and Ako, slept with their guns and\\r\\nswords by their sides. They declared that if attacked they would sell\\r\\ntheir lives as dearly as possible. But Father Hennepin said to them, \"I\\r\\nshall allow myself to be killed without any resistance. I came to\\r\\nannounce to the savages a God, who for the world\\'s redemption allowed\\r\\nHimself to be falsely accused, unjustly condemned, and cruelly\\r\\ncrucified, without showing the least enmity to those who put Him to\\r\\ndeath. I shall imitate the example thus set me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe night passed peacefully away, and the morning of the 12th of April\\r\\ndawned upon this scene so wild and picturesque.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs all were gathered around their camp fires, cooking their breakfasts,\\r\\none of the chiefs, Narketoba by name--presenting a hideous aspect in\\r\\nhis barbarian military trappings, his face and bare chest smeared with\\r\\nwar paint--approached Father Hennepin and asked for the peace calumet.\\r\\nReceiving it, he filled the cup with tobacco, and having taken a few\\r\\nwhiffs himself, presented it to one after another of the whole band.\\r\\nEach one smoked the pipe, though some with evident reluctance. The\\r\\nFrenchmen understood this to indicate that, for the present at least,\\r\\ntheir lives were to be spared. They were then informed that they must\\r\\naccompany the Indians up the river to their own country.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was not sorry,\" Father Hennepin writes, \"in this conjuncture, to\\r\\ncontinue our discovery with this people.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Life with the Savages_.\\r\\n\\r\\nAscending the River with the Savages.

Sufferings of the Captives.\\r\\nCapricious Treatment. Triumphal Entrance. The Adoption. Habits of the\\r\\nSavages.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFather Hennepin and his two companions reÃ«mbarked in their canoe, and,\\r\\noppressed with varied feelings of anxiety and curiosity, recommenced\\r\\ntheir journey up the river. The thirty large canoes, filled with their\\r\\ncaptors, surrounded them. The current was rapid; the savages were\\r\\nseldom in a hurry, and their progress was slow. At night they always\\r\\nlanded and slept in the open air, unless it was stormy, when they would\\r\\nsometimes construct for themselves a frail shelter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe devout ecclesiastic felt in duty bound daily to say his office, as\\r\\nit was called, in accordance with the rules of the Catholic Church. He\\r\\nhad his breviary, composed of matins, lauds, vespers, and compline, or\\r\\nlast prayer at night. These exercises he scrupulously performed. The\\r\\nsuperstitious Indians, seeing him open his book, and move his lips,\\r\\nimagined that he was practising some sort of incantation against them.\\r\\nAngrily they cried out against it, exclaiming, in their own language,\\r\\n\"witchcraft.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMichael Ako, who had no ambition to receive a martyr\\'s crown, entreated\\r\\nhim, if he must say his prayers, to say them in secret. \"If you persist\\r\\nin this course,\" said he, \"you will so provoke the Indians, that we\\r\\nshall all be inevitably killed.\" Auguelle, who was more religiously\\r\\ninclined, joined in these entreaties, begging him to retire apart,\\r\\nmorning and evening, into the forest for his devotions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the suspicions of the Indians were aroused. They had a great dread\\r\\nof diabolical influences. Whenever he entered the woods a party\\r\\nfollowed him. He could get no chance to pray out of their sight. At\\r\\nlength he said to his companions:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot dispense with my prayers, whatever may be the consequences.\\r\\nIf we are all massacred, I shall be the innocent cause of your death,\\r\\nas well as of my own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo accustom the Indians to his mode of worship, he commenced chanting\\r\\nthe litany of the Virgin. He had a well-trained, melodious voice. The\\r\\nIndians were pleased with the novel strains floating over the still\\r\\nwaters. Paddle in hand they paused to listen. Adroitly, he led them to\\r\\nbelieve that the Good Spirit had taught him to sing, and had sent him\\r\\nto them for their diversion. It would seem, on the whole, that the\\r\\nIndians treated their captives with remarkable kindness. The canoe of\\r\\nthe Frenchmen was heavily laden with articles for trade, and there were\\r\\nbut three to paddle. They therefore found it very difficult to keep up\\r\\nwith the well-manned war canoes of the savages. The chief placed one or\\r\\ntwo warriors on board the Frenchmen\\'s boat, to help them stem the\\r\\ncurrent. It was with difficulty that the little fleet accomplished more\\r\\nthan twenty or twenty-five miles a day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe savages were collected from various villages, and it was quite\\r\\nevident that they were still divided in opinion respecting the\\r\\ndisposition to be made of their prisoners. One of the chiefs took the\\r\\nFrenchmen under his special protection. He caused them, at each\\r\\nencampment, to occupy the same cabin with him, or to sleep by his side.\\r\\nBut there was another chief who clamored for their death. He had lost a\\r\\nson, killed by the Miamis. Every night his dismal howlings were heard,\\r\\nas he wailed piteously, endeavoring to stimulate his own passions, and\\r\\nto rouse his comrades to kill the Frenchmen, so as to seize their arms\\r\\nand avenge themselves upon the Miamis.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut others, who were far more considerate, said, If we kill or rob\\r\\nthese Frenchmen, we shall soon use up the few goods they have in their\\r\\ncanoe, and no other Frenchmen will dare to visit us to bring us more.\\r\\nBut, if we treat them kindly, and purchase their goods fairly, others\\r\\nwill come, bringing a great abundance. Thus we can all sell our skins\\r\\nand furs, and supply the whole tribe with the things we so greatly\\r\\nneed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they were paddling along one day, a large flock of turkeys was seen\\r\\nfeeding near the river. Cautiously Father Hennepin paddled near them,\\r\\nand one of his boatmen, taking careful aim, struck down three with a\\r\\nsingle shot. The savages, who had watched the proceeding with intense\\r\\ninterest, were amazed. Many of them, perhaps all, had never seen a gun\\r\\ndischarged before, though the knowledge of the arrival of the French,\\r\\nand the wonderful power of their guns, had been widely spread through\\r\\nthe tribes. The canoes were all paddled to the shore. With the deepest\\r\\ninterest they examined the dead turkeys, and reÃ«xamined the musket. The\\r\\nunseen bolt had struck them down at twice the distance their arrows\\r\\nwould reach. An arrow could have killed but one. The bullet had killed\\r\\nthree. \"Manza ouacangege,\" exclaimed one of the chiefs, in astonishment,\\r\\nwhich signified, _The iron has understanding_.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe situation of the Frenchmen was very peculiar, as they hardly knew\\r\\nwhether the savages regarded them as prisoners or not. Father Hennepin\\r\\nwas still pursuing his original design of exploring the sources of the\\r\\nMississippi. If the Indians were truly friendly, their companionship\\r\\nwas an element of safety, and was to be desired. In order to test the\\r\\nquestion whether he was his own master, and could follow his own will,\\r\\nhe suggested to the chief his design of turning back and following down\\r\\nthe Mississippi to its mouth. He might thus find a short passage to the\\r\\nIndies, though he admits that he thought it more probable that it\\r\\nemptied into the Gulf of Mexico, than into the Red Sea. The chiefs\\r\\nhowever, promptly signified that they could not consent to be thus\\r\\ndeprived of the pleasure of his company.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the Indians paddled all day long, with great vigor, against the\\r\\ncurrent, not stopping even to eat until their night\\'s encampment, they\\r\\nnever seemed at all fatigued. There was an ample supply of game for\\r\\nfood. Having reared their frail shelters, if it rained, kindled their\\r\\nfires and cooked their suppers, they invariably had a war dance, each\\r\\nsmoking in turn the war calumet. This was distinguished from the peace\\r\\ncalumet by different colored feathers. Their whoops and yells were\\r\\nhideous. And there was something indescribably mournful in the wailings\\r\\nof those who had lost relatives during the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nFortunately for the French, all their expeditions had thus far been\\r\\nconducted under the control of religious men. Not an Indian had been\\r\\nkilled or wronged by them. They had proved only great benefactors to\\r\\nthe Indians. Had a solitary Indian been killed by any Frenchmen, these\\r\\ncaptives, in revenge, would have been put to death with tortures of the\\r\\nmost diabolical cruelty. Had any Miami warriors fallen into the hands\\r\\nof these savages, awful would have been their doom. Father Hennepin and\\r\\nhis companions could not but shudder as they listened to the wailing\\r\\nyells of those who mourned their dead, and witnessed the fiend-like\\r\\nexpression of their countenances and gestures.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the earliest dawn, after the night\\'s encampment, some one gave a\\r\\nwhoop, which instantly brought every man to his feet. No time was lost\\r\\nin washing or dressing. They generally, as a measure of protection\\r\\nagainst their enemies, endeavored to encamp upon the point of an\\r\\nisland. While some went out to hunt for game, others replenished the\\r\\nfires, and cooked the breakfast, while still others sought the\\r\\nneighboring eminences to discover whether there were any smoke or other\\r\\nindications of a lurking foe. They then entered their birch canoes,\\r\\nwhich they did not leave until the close of the afternoon, when they\\r\\nlanded for another night\\'s encampment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus for nineteen days they continued ascending the river. Father\\r\\nHennepin estimated that they had made between three and four hundred\\r\\nmiles.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne afternoon, as the thirty canoes were being paddled up the stream in\\r\\na long line, a large bear was seen swimming across the river, a little\\r\\nabove them. The canoes in advance promptly surrounded him, and he was\\r\\nspeedily killed. Upon dragging him ashore he proved to be a monster in\\r\\nsize, and very fat. It so happened that they were opposite a very\\r\\nbeautiful prairie. The head chief, whose name was Aguipaguetin, ordered\\r\\nall the canoes ashore for a grand feast. The warriors decorated\\r\\nthemselves with paint and feathers, and after partaking of what they\\r\\nconsidered a sumptuous feast, commenced the wild orgies of the war\\r\\ndance, with hideous yellings and contortions. They all leaped about on\\r\\nthe greensward of the prairie, with their arms akimbo, and violently\\r\\nbeating the ground with their feet, in measured tread.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wailing for the dead was blended with their discordant cries. One\\r\\nof the chiefs who was very loud in his demonstrations of grief for his\\r\\nlost son, and who had previously urged putting the Frenchmen to death,\\r\\nfrequently in the course of the frantic dance approached the Frenchmen,\\r\\nand placing his hands on each one of their heads, uttered the most\\r\\npiercing dirge-like cries. Father Hennepin could not understand the\\r\\nsignificance of this strange ceremony, but he had many fears that it\\r\\nindicated violence to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nHoping to conciliate the chief, he made him a very valuable present of\\r\\nknives, axes, beads, and tobacco in honor of the son whose loss he so\\r\\ndeeply deplored. By these frequent presents, the small store of goods\\r\\nwhich the canoe could hold was rapidly disappearing. They were then on\\r\\nthe borders of a wide expansion of the Mississippi resembling a lake.\\r\\nFather Hennepin gave it the name of Pepin, or the Lake of Tears, from\\r\\nthe lugubrious cries of the chieftain in the funereal dance. The next\\r\\nday, or day after, quite a large herd of buffaloes was seen swimming\\r\\nacross the river. The enormous creatures, thus taken at disadvantage,\\r\\nwere easily killed. Thirty or forty, pierced by arrows and javelins,\\r\\nwere soon dragged ashore. The savages had another feast, from the\\r\\ntongues and other most delicate morsels of the animal. All the\\r\\nremainder was left to putrefy, or be devoured by wild beasts. The frail\\r\\ncanoes were so crowded that there was no room to store away any game.\\r\\nNeither was there need to do so, for every day brought almost\\r\\ninvariably a full supply. It required hunger, and an acquired appetite\\r\\nfor such food, to make it palatable; for it was eaten without bread or\\r\\nsalt, or any other seasoning.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome days the Indians seemed very good natured. Again, with no known\\r\\ncause, they were morose and threatening. Even the chief who had\\r\\nprotected them was as capricious in his conduct as a child. He would at\\r\\ntimes feed them abundantly, minister to all their wants, and caress\\r\\nthem. Again he would allow them, in a stormy night, to be driven from\\r\\nhis cabin, to find such shelter as they could. Usually some Indians\\r\\nwould be placed in their canoe to help them paddle. Again they would be\\r\\nleft to struggle unaided against the rushing flood. The Frenchmen could\\r\\nnot speak a word of the language of their captors, or understand a word\\r\\nspoken to them. It is probable that they often misunderstood the\\r\\nsignificance of signs. But there was no difficulty in perceiving the\\r\\ndifference between smiles and frowns, between blessings and curses.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the nineteenth day of their navigation, the Indians reached one of\\r\\ntheir villages on the river banks. It was afterwards found that this\\r\\nspot was about twenty-five miles below a remarkable fall in the river,\\r\\nto which Father Hennepin gave, in honor of his patron saint, the name\\r\\nof the Falls of St. Anthony. This hamlet, far away in the north, was a\\r\\ncold and cheerless assemblage of savage homes. The families, in the\\r\\nculture and comforts of life, were but slightly elevated above the\\r\\nbrutes around them. There were several chiefs who had lost sons during\\r\\nthe war. The captives were given one to each of three of them.\\r\\nNominally, they were to be adopted in the place of the lost ones. In\\r\\nreality, they were slaves, to be driven farthest from the fire, to have\\r\\nthe most scanty supply of food, in case of want, and in all things to\\r\\nendure the hardest fare.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving thus distributed their captives, the savages seized their\\r\\nproperty and divided it among themselves. They probably did not\\r\\nconsider this an act of robbery, but since the Frenchmen had been\\r\\ngraciously received as sons of the tribe, their goods should be\\r\\nappropriated to the public welfare. The village near the Falls of St.\\r\\nAnthony was but a temporary encampment. The tribe into whose hands the\\r\\ncaptives had fallen, was called Issatis. Their principal village was\\r\\nstill farther up the river, nearly a hundred and fifty miles in a\\r\\nnorthwesterly direction. Probably in consequence of the innumerable\\r\\nwindings of the stream, they abandoned their canoes at the Falls, and\\r\\ncommenced the journey on foot, traversing an Indian trail which led\\r\\nthrough forest and moor, over prairie and mountain. It was indeed a\\r\\nwearisome and almost fatal journey to those newly adopted into such\\r\\nhardships of barbarian life. In those early days of spring, and in\\r\\nthose high latitudes, it was often bitterly cold. There were remaining\\r\\nsnow drifts, and deeper clammy mud and pools of water to be waded,\\r\\nskimmed over with ice, and freezing storms of rain and sleet. They\\r\\nencountered many rivers and swollen brooks, which they were compelled\\r\\neither to swim or ford.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese streams, flowing down from unknown regions in the north, were\\r\\noften encumbered with large blocks of ice. There was but little game in\\r\\nthose dismal forests, and on those sear and bleak prairies. The savages\\r\\nwere pitiless, and would often give but a meagre portion to their\\r\\nadopted brethren. Father Hennepin often divested himself of his\\r\\nclothes, bound them upon his head, and swam across these streams. Upon\\r\\nreaching the shore, his limbs would be so chilled and benumbed that he\\r\\ncould scarcely stand. The blood would trickle down his body and limbs,\\r\\nfrom wounds inflicted by the sharp edges of the ice. The trail\\r\\ninvariably led to spots where the crossings of the swollen streams were\\r\\nnot very wide. Several of the Indians were men of gigantic stature.\\r\\nFather Hennepin was a tall man, but his companions were very short, and\\r\\nneither of them could swim. When they came to a ford where the water\\r\\nwas over the heads of the short men these tall Indians would carry them\\r\\nacross on their shoulders. When all were compelled to swim they would\\r\\nhelp the unfortunate men across on pieces of drift wood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indians seemed to have sinews of steel. They were alike insensible\\r\\nto hunger, to drenched garments, and to freezing blasts. The celerity\\r\\nwith which they pressed on their way, astonished the Europeans. On\\r\\nseveral occasions Father Hennepin, while traversing the broad bleak\\r\\nprairie, was quite in despair. His trembling, tottering limbs would\\r\\nscarcely support his body. Once, feeling unable to take another step,\\r\\nhe threw himself upon the ground, declaring that there he must die. The\\r\\nrank and withered grass of the prairie was five or six feet high. Very\\r\\ndeliberately one of the savages set fire to the grass. It burst forth\\r\\nin a consuming flame. \"Now,\" said he, \"you may follow us or be burned\\r\\nto death.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn one occasion, when Father Hennepin had thrown himself upon the\\r\\nground, in utter exhaustion, one of the chiefs of the party came to\\r\\nhim, and pulling up a quantity of dried grass, made a soft bed for him\\r\\nto lie down upon. Then seating himself by his side, he took from his\\r\\npocket two pieces of wood, very dry. One was a small block of cedar,\\r\\nwith an indentation in the centre, about two thirds of an inch in\\r\\ndiameter. The other was a round peg, five or six inches long, which\\r\\nfitted into the hole in the block. This block he placed upon his knee,\\r\\nand fitting the peg into the socket, spun it round with wonderful\\r\\nrapidity between his two palms. Soon smoke began to appear, then a few\\r\\nsparks were elicited, and then a gentle flame rose from the dust of the\\r\\ncharred wood. He lighted his pipe, and after smoking for a moment, gave\\r\\nit Father Hennepin to smoke. He then put his hands affectionately on\\r\\nthe Frenchman\\'s head, and moaned and wept.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat did this all mean? Were the sympathies of the savage excited, in\\r\\nview of the sufferings of the white man? Were his tears caused to flow\\r\\nin anticipation of torture at the burning stake, to which he might\\r\\nsuppose the victim to be doomed? Or was this an act of barbarian\\r\\nmourning over some loved one lost in battle? Father Hennepin could not\\r\\ninterpret the deed. But he greatly feared that it indicated dreadful\\r\\nwoes to come--sufferings, the thought of which was sufficient to\\r\\nagitate even a savage breast.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a weary journey of five days, this party of forty or fifty\\r\\nwarriors, with their captives, approached their destined village. It\\r\\nwas far away in the northern wilderness, east of the Mississippi, which\\r\\nmajestic stream had there dwindled into a rivulet. They were near the\\r\\nhead waters of a river, since called the St. Francis. It was indeed a\\r\\ndreary and savage wild which they had penetrated, and from whose glooms\\r\\nthe captives could not expect ever to emerge. In some way the\\r\\ninhabitants of the village had heard of the approach of the warriors,\\r\\nand quite a number of the women and children came out to meet them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a sort of triumphal entrance, like that of the ancient Romans, they\\r\\ntook Auguelle, dressed him as gorgeously as they could, in Indian\\r\\ncostume, painted his face, daubed his hair with grease, and fastened\\r\\nupon his head a plume of eagle\\'s feathers, brilliantly colored. They\\r\\nplaced a gourd in his hand, containing a number of round pebbles, which\\r\\nhe was directed to shake for music, with the accompaniment of his\\r\\nvoice, shouting a French song. The Frenchmen, in dreadful incertitude\\r\\nrespecting their fate, were agreed in the conviction that it was good\\r\\npolicy to do every thing in their power to conciliate their captors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe warriors were much chagrined in returning from their expedition\\r\\nwithout a single scalp, without a single captive from their enemies,\\r\\nwithout having even struck a blow. It was necessary for them therefore\\r\\nto make as much parade as they could of their French prisoners. Yet the\\r\\nmost ignorant Indian of them all could not but perceive that there was\\r\\nnot much to be boasted of in a hundred and twenty warriors having\\r\\npicked up three peaceful canoe men, who had made no resistance, who had\\r\\nnever done them any harm; who had come into their country as friends,\\r\\nmaking them rich presents, and who undeniably desired only to do them\\r\\ngood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey could not utter the scalp halloo, nor the yell announcing that\\r\\nthey were bringing victims for the stake. But they made the forest\\r\\nresound with their war-whoops, and with their shouts of triumph. During\\r\\nthe absence of the war party, the women and the old men had planted\\r\\nseveral stakes, and had gathered around their large quantities of dried\\r\\ngrass, with which they intended to scorch and blister and consume the\\r\\nprisoners, whom they doubted not the victors would bring back. They\\r\\nwere anticipating a grand gala day in dance and yell, as they witnessed\\r\\nthe writhings of their victims and listened with delight to the shrieks\\r\\nwhich agony extorted.\\r\\n\\r\\nFather Hennepin and his companions were appalled as they looked at\\r\\nthese stakes and these preparations for torture, and feared that they\\r\\nwere to occupy the places prepared for the Miamis. They, however,\\r\\nconcealed their fears, carefully abstained from the slightest\\r\\nindication of anxiety, and assumed that they were contented and beloved\\r\\nmembers of the tribe which had adopted them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was about the 21st of April, 1680, when these unfortunate men, who\\r\\nhad been cradled in France, were led into the miserable hovels of this\\r\\nvillage of savages. They were all conducted into the wigwam of the\\r\\nprincipal chief. Here, much to their encouragement, the chief presented\\r\\nthem his own peace calumet, to smoke. He then gave them, in a birch\\r\\nbark dish, some boiled wild rice, seasoned with dry whortleberries.\\r\\nHalf-famished as the Frenchmen were, this was by no means unpalatable\\r\\nfood.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this feast each one was conducted to the wigwam of the Indian by\\r\\nwhom he had been adopted. These Indians lived in different villages\\r\\nseveral miles apart. The captives now found, much to their sorrow, that\\r\\nthey were to be separated. Father Hennepin was adopted by the chief\\r\\nAquipaguetin, and was conducted nearly three miles, often through\\r\\nmarshes knee-deep with mud and water, till they came to a considerable\\r\\nstream, probably one of the upper tributaries of the St. Francis River.\\r\\nHere five wives of the chief, with their canoes, were obsequiously\\r\\nwaiting the approach of their lord and master. A young son of the chief\\r\\nwas also with them. The chief informed them all that he had adopted the\\r\\nwhite man in the place of the child he had lost; and that his wives\\r\\nwere to call him their son, and that his son was to call him brother.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe women paddled the canoes down the dark stream fringed with gloomy\\r\\nevergreens and tangled underbrush, until they came to an island upon\\r\\nwhich there was a small cluster of cabins. Here was the residence of\\r\\nthe chief. His wigwam was large, though but a single room, and was\\r\\ncrowded with his wives and children. Father Hennepin was immediately\\r\\npresented with some boiled fish on a birch bark plate. But he was so\\r\\nvery weak, from exposure, toil, and emaciation, that he could not rise\\r\\nfrom the ground without assistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe medical practice of the chief was peculiar; but either in\\r\\nconsequence of it, or in spite of it, the sick man got well. A small\\r\\nhut, called a sweating cabin, was built, very tight. This was made more\\r\\nimpervious to the air by covering it with buffalo skins. A large number\\r\\nof stones heated red hot were placed inside, which raised the\\r\\ntemperature almost to that of an oven. The sick man crept in, followed\\r\\nby four medical practitioners. The entrance was closed. The Indians\\r\\nthen began to wail and howl, probably to frighten off the evil spirits,\\r\\nwho they supposed had invaded the sick man\\'s body. At the same time\\r\\nthey commenced rubbing their patient violently from head to foot. The\\r\\nperspiration oozed from every pore, and fell from him like rain drops.\\r\\nThe heat was intolerable. He nearly fainted, and was for the time\\r\\ngreatly debilitated. This regimen was followed three times a week for\\r\\ntwo or three weeks, when, Father Hennepin writes:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"I felt as strong as ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Escape from the Savages._\\r\\n\\r\\nPreaching to the Indians.

The Return Voyage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a singular combination of intelligence and childish\\r\\nsimplicity developed by the Indians. Father Hennepin had a small pocket\\r\\ncompass, of which they stood in great need. When they saw him turn the\\r\\nneedle with a key, they were awe-stricken, and whispered to one another\\r\\nthat it was a spirit which had become obedient to the white man\\'s will.\\r\\nHe had an iron pot, with three feet resembling a lion\\'s paws. This they\\r\\nnever dared to touch, unless their hands were covered with some robe.\\r\\nWhat could have been the cause of this senseless fear, it is impossible\\r\\nto imagine. The same men on other subjects would reason with great\\r\\nlogical acumen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good ecclesiastic was still very anxious for the conversion of the\\r\\nIndians. He manifested more solicitude for their salvation, than for\\r\\nhis own restoration to liberty or the preservation of his own life. He\\r\\nimmediately entered upon the vigorous study of the language. Having\\r\\nlearned that the phrase, \"Taket chia biheu,\" meant, \"How do you call\\r\\nthat,\" he commenced compiling a dictionary. He had a natural facility\\r\\nfor the acquisition of languages, and made rapid progress. Fortunately\\r\\nhe had paper and ink, and eagle\\'s quills were easily obtained.\\r\\n\\r\\nHour after hour he spent inquiring the meaning of words and the names\\r\\nof things. The chiefs were quite pleased in teaching him and in seeing\\r\\nhow fast he was acquiring the power of talking with them on all\\r\\nfamiliar subjects. His writing the words was an inexplicable mystery to\\r\\nthem. They would often question him respecting the names of things. He\\r\\nwould refer to his memorandum and then tell them correctly. This not\\r\\nonly surprised but seemed to overawe them.\\r\\n\\r\\nFather Louis Hennepin was called, by his two French boatmen, PÃ¨re\\r\\nLouis. The chief who had adopted him was one day exhibiting to some\\r\\nchiefs who were visiting his wigwam, this wonderful power of the white\\r\\nman in recalling a difficult name, by looking at the characters he had\\r\\nwritten. Very solemnly he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There must be an invisible spirit who tells PÃ¨re Louis everything we\\r\\nsay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither of the other Frenchmen could write. The dress of the\\r\\necclesiastic was much more imposing than that of the boatmen. He was a\\r\\ntall, fine-looking man, ever moving with that dignity which seems\\r\\ninstinctive in one accustomed to command. The keen-sighted Indians were\\r\\nnot slow in recognizing his superiority of rank, and all considered him\\r\\ninvested with supernatural powers. Often, when it rained as they were\\r\\nwishing to go hunting, they would entreat him to sweep away the clouds.\\r\\nHis invariable reply was, pointing to the skies, \"The Great Spirit\\r\\nthere controls all things. I have no such ability.\" They stood in awe\\r\\nof his spiritual power, and their good feelings were won by his\\r\\ninvariable serenity and kindness. They contributed beaver skins, to the\\r\\nvalue of about one hundred dollars, which they presented to him to\\r\\ninduce him to remain and take some wives and have a richly furnished\\r\\nwigwam. But he declined the present, saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not come among you to collect beaver skins, but to teach you to\\r\\nlove and obey the Great Spirit. I wish to live as you do, sharing your\\r\\nhard fare.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nVery wisely he assumed that he came voluntarily among them, and that\\r\\nwhen the time came for his departure, no one would think of throwing\\r\\nany obstacle in his way. It was a time almost of famine with the\\r\\nIndians. The summer birds had not returned. Game was very scarce. There\\r\\nwas great suffering for want of food. And these strangely inconsistent\\r\\ncreatures, while affecting the greatest kindness, would conceal the\\r\\nlittle food they had, get up in the night and eat it secretly, leaving\\r\\nPÃ¨re Hennepin to the gnawings of hunger.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Although women,\" he writes, \"are for the most part more kind and\\r\\ncompassionate than men, they gave what little fish they had to their\\r\\nchildren, regarding me as a slave made by their warriors in their\\r\\nenemy\\'s country, and they reasonably preferred their children\\'s lives\\r\\nto mine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day a deliberative council of Issati chiefs was held, to consult\\r\\nrespecting various matters. PÃ¨re Louis, having been adopted into the\\r\\ntribe as the son of the head chief, attended. He could understand\\r\\nnearly all that was said. There was a very able chief, by the name of\\r\\nOu-si-cou-dÃ¨, who had manifested great esteem for the father. He rose\\r\\nand said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We all ought to feel indignant in view of the insulting manner in\\r\\nwhich our young men treated PÃ¨re Louis on the way. They were young\\r\\nwarriors without sense, and perhaps knew no better. They robbed him and\\r\\nwanted to kill him. They acted like hungry dogs, who snatch a bit of\\r\\nmeat from the bark dish, and run. They abused men who brought us iron\\r\\nand merchandise, which we never had before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPÃ¨re Louis had considerable medical skill, and had brought with him\\r\\nseveral simple remedies. He was ever ready to attend the sick, and his\\r\\nsuccess in medical practice gave him great renown. A little child was\\r\\ndying. According to the belief of Father Hennepin, if it should die\\r\\nunbaptized, it was lost. But how could he baptize the heathen child of\\r\\nheathen parents. Great was his anxiety, and fervent were his prayers\\r\\nfor enlightenment. At length his kind heart obtained the victory over\\r\\nhis theological creed. The solemn rite was performed with deepest\\r\\nemotion. Giving the child, a little girl, the Christian name of\\r\\nAntoinette, in honor of St. Anthony, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Creature of God, I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the\\r\\nSon, and of the Holy Ghost.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo his great grief he could not say mass, for want of wine and the\\r\\nappropriate vestments, which had been taken from him. He however spread\\r\\nan altar cloth, which he had retained about his person, upon the body\\r\\nof the child. When the spirit had taken its flight, he gave the remains\\r\\nChristian burial.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe news of the arrival of the Frenchmen in the villages of Issati,\\r\\nspread far and wide through the adjacent tribes. An embassy of Indians\\r\\ncame to visit Father Hennepin from the distance of several hundred\\r\\nmiles in the far west. They approached him with reverence, and had many\\r\\nquestions to ask him. They were men of high rank and dignity, and their\\r\\nquestions indicated much thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We live,\" they said, \"in a much milder clime, where there are immense\\r\\nplains and boundless prairies; where herds of thousands of buffaloes\\r\\nroam, and where deer and turkeys and innumerable other kinds of game\\r\\nare found in abundance. There is no hunger there, for food can always\\r\\nbe obtained.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey expressed the earnest wish to take Father Hennepin back with them.\\r\\nBut his own tribe were just about to set out on a grand hunting\\r\\nexcursion, to the sunny realms of the southwest. A hundred and thirty\\r\\nfamilies, and also two hundred and fifty warriors, embarked in a fleet\\r\\nof eighty birch canoes, about the middle of July. The embarcation was a\\r\\nwondrous spectacle, such as civilized eyes have rarely beheld, and can\\r\\nnever witness again. A canoe had been provided for the three Frenchmen.\\r\\nBut the two Frenchmen were jealous of the extraordinary respect with\\r\\nwhich Father Hennepin was treated and refused to take him on board.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs this strange fleet in a long and straggling line descended the St.\\r\\nFrancis River, Father Hennepin stood upon the banks extending his hands\\r\\nin a benediction. Two Indians, passing by in a small canoe, seeing him\\r\\nthus deserted, paddled ashore and took him with them. This overloaded\\r\\nthe canoe, and it began to leak. It required constant exertion on the\\r\\npart of Father Hennepin to bail out the water with a small birch cup,\\r\\nas fast as it ran in. The canoe did not weigh fifty pounds. Great care\\r\\nwas necessary to preserve its equilibrium, for almost the slightest\\r\\nirregular motion of the body would upset it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt night all landed. Sleeping in the canoes, or navigating them in the\\r\\ndark, was impossible. Here again one of the strangest of earthly\\r\\nspectacles was witnessed. Beneath the gloomy pines which fringed the\\r\\nstream, countless camp fires were gleaming. Men, women and children\\r\\nwere running about in all directions. Some were cooking the supper;\\r\\nsome, rearing frail shelters for the night. There was chattering and\\r\\nbandied jokes and laughter. The proud warriors, despising any menial\\r\\nemployment, strutted about with lordly air.\\r\\n\\r\\nMichael Ako was a most graceless fellow, and it was his influence which\\r\\nhad excluded Father Hennepin from the canoe. But Anthony Auguelle was\\r\\nmuch more devoutly inclined. He was ashamed of their conduct. In the\\r\\nevening he sought out Father Hennepin, and offered a poor excuse for\\r\\nnot receiving him into their canoe, saying it was so small and frail\\r\\nthat had three been in it, it would inevitably have been swamped. The\\r\\nfather was not deceived, though he accepted the apology.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter four days\\' paddling down the St. Francis River, the little fleet\\r\\nreached its mouth, where it empties into the Mississippi. They crossed\\r\\nto the west shore of the great river, and encamped upon an eminence\\r\\nthere. It was impossible for Father Hennepin to be very accurate in his\\r\\nestimate of distances. He judged that they were then about twenty-four\\r\\nmiles above the Falls of St. Anthony.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this spot there was a forest of birch trees, and suitable wood for\\r\\ncanoe frames. They had commenced the voyage with old canoes, which were\\r\\nfrail and decayed, and in which they could not safely launch forth upon\\r\\nthe turbulent flood of the Mississippi. The whole band consequently\\r\\nencamped for several days upon this eminence, to construct new canoes.\\r\\nThe veteran hunters wandered through the forests and over the prairies,\\r\\nto hunt stags, deer, and beaver. The larger boys and girls brought to\\r\\nthe encampment their arms full of birch bark, with carefully selected\\r\\ntwigs for frames. The experienced women, with nimble fingers, joined\\r\\nthe seams and fashioned the buoyant and graceful boat. All were busy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the hunters were unsuccessful. They brought in but little game. The\\r\\nwhole community was fed upon thin broth, and there was but little of\\r\\nthat. Father Hennepin, accompanied by Anthony Auguelle, in their great\\r\\nhunger, wandered about searching for wild berries. They found but few,\\r\\nand those which they ate often made them sick. The surly Michael Ako\\r\\nrefused to go with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tribe of Indians encamped in July, 1680, upon the Upper Mississippi,\\r\\nopposite the mouth of St. Francis River, numbered between four and five\\r\\nhundred souls. There was a great want of food in the camp. According to\\r\\nFather Hennepin\\'s estimate, they were about two hundred miles above the\\r\\nmouth of the Wisconsin River. He told the Indians that when La Salle\\r\\nleft CrÃ¨vecoeur for Fort Frontenac to obtain supplies, he promised to\\r\\nsend to the mouth of the Wisconsin River, a reinforcement of men, with\\r\\npowder and guns, and very many other articles for traffic with the\\r\\nIndians.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey therefore consented that he should descend the river to this\\r\\npoint, to obtain the supplies. These strange men were too polite to\\r\\nintimate that they distrusted his word and considered this merely a\\r\\nplan devised for his escape, as it probably was. They however,\\r\\nfurnished him with a canoe only sufficiently large to bear him and\\r\\nAnthony Auguelle, with their needful luggage. By this contrivance,\\r\\nMichael Ako was left behind as a hostage for their return.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two Frenchmen set out, in a birch bark canoe, for this river\\r\\nvoyage, going and returning, of four hundred miles. The only articles\\r\\nthey could obtain to take with them, to meet the casualties of the way,\\r\\nwere a gun, fifteen charges of powder, a knife, an earthen pot, and two\\r\\nrobes of beaver skins, as blankets for the night\\'s encampments. They\\r\\nsafely reached the falls. Taking the canoe and freight upon their\\r\\nshoulders, they carried them along the well-trodden trail which\\r\\nconstituted the portage. Here they found five or six of their Indian\\r\\nhunters. One of them had climbed a gnarled oak tree opposite the\\r\\nfoaming cataract, and was offering the following prayer, which Father\\r\\nHennepin took down on the spot. Peculiar moans and wails, as of\\r\\npenitence, were blended with the prayer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"O Thou who art a Great Spirit, grant that our nation may pass these\\r\\nFalls quietly without harm. Help us to kill buffaloes in abundance. May\\r\\nwe take prisoners who shall serve us as slaves. Some of them we will\\r\\nput to death in thine honor. Aid us to avenge our kindred whom they\\r\\nhave killed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time this devout savage hung upon the tree, as an offering\\r\\nto the spirit of the falls, a rich robe of fur, gorgeously fringed and\\r\\nembroidered with porcupines\\' quills, variously colored. A few miles\\r\\nbelow the falls, they met another party of four or five hunters. They\\r\\nwere encamped upon a small island, and were feasting upon an abundance\\r\\nof buffalo meat. The Frenchmen paddled ashore and joined eagerly in the\\r\\nrepast. Scarcely two hours had elapsed ere four or five more canoes\\r\\nwere seen descending the river. Sixteen warrior hunters of their own\\r\\nparty leaped ashore. They seemed to be very angry. Tomahawk in hand,\\r\\nthey knocked their cabin to pieces, and seized all the meat. Father\\r\\nHennepin was astonished, and inquired what this meant. One of the\\r\\nwarriors, who professed to be his uncle, replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These men, contrary to our laws, have gone on a buffalo hunt before\\r\\nthe rest. Thus, while they have furnished themselves with an abundance\\r\\nof meat, they have frightened away the buffaloes, and left us destitute.\\r\\nIn punishment, we have a right to strip them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two solitary voyagers paddled down the stream, as they judged, one\\r\\nhundred and sixty miles. During this time they killed but one deer,\\r\\nwhich they shot as it was swimming across the river. The July heat was\\r\\nsuch that the flesh could be kept but for a few hours. They saw many\\r\\nturtles. But for a long time in vain they endeavored to take one. The\\r\\ntimid animals would plunge into the water the moment they heard the\\r\\nleast noise. At last they succeeded in taking one of them. But as\\r\\nFather Hennepin endeavored to cut off the turtle\\'s head, he came very\\r\\nnear losing one of his own fingers in its sharp jaws. The Frenchmen\\r\\nwere very hungry, and had paddled their canoe to the shore. While the\\r\\nfather was endeavoring to dress the turtle to be cooked. Anthony, with\\r\\nhis gun, went back into the prairie, hoping to shoot some game. Father\\r\\nHennepin chanced to look up from his work, and behold, a gust of wind\\r\\nhad swept the canoe from the shore out into the stream, and it was\\r\\nfloating rapidly down on the strong current.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnless the canoe could be recovered, this would prove a terrible\\r\\ncalamity. Not a moment was to be lost. Divesting himself of most of his\\r\\nclothing, he plunged into the stream, and being a strong swimmer, soon\\r\\novertook the boat. It floated buoyant as an eggshell. He could not get\\r\\ninto it. By pushing it before him he succeeded in effecting a landing,\\r\\nabout half a mile down stream, and quite cut of sight of the spot he\\r\\nhad left. In the meantime Anthony returned. Seeing the half-dressed\\r\\nturtle, and the father and the canoe both gone, he was thrown into a\\r\\ndreadful panic. He could not doubt that some hostile Indians had\\r\\nappeared and carried them both away, and that he was abandoned to\\r\\nperish of starvation. He went back into the prairie, to ascend an\\r\\neminence which commanded a view of the country for some distance\\r\\naround.\\r\\n\\r\\nFather Hennepin paddled up the stream with all possible diligence, drew\\r\\nthe canoe well upon the shore, and had just reclothed himself, when he\\r\\nsaw, near by, a herd of sixty buffaloes, swimming across the river.\\r\\nAnthony had the only gun. The father ran back into the prairie,\\r\\nshouting for him with all his might. It was indeed a joyful cry which\\r\\nreached the ears of Anthony. Eagerly he responded to it. They sprang\\r\\ninto the canoe, pursued the buffaloes, and succeeded in shooting one.\\r\\nThey towed him to the bank of the river. The father paddled, Anthony\\r\\nholding the huge carcass by the horns. But they could not drag the\\r\\ncreature ashore. They could only cut off the tender morsels and leave\\r\\nthe remainder to float down the stream. In consequence of their great\\r\\nhunger they ate so voraciously, that they were both made sick, and for\\r\\ntwo days could not leave their camp. Father Hennepin writes:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Never have we more admired God\\'s providence than during this\\r\\n    voyage. We could not always find game. And when we did, could take\\r\\n    but little meat with us, as our canoe was so small, and besides,\\r\\n    the excessive heat spoiled it. When we embarked in the morning, we\\r\\n    seldom knew what we should have to eat during the day. But the\\r\\n    eagles, which were very common in those vast countries, frequently\\r\\n    dropped from their claws large fishes, which they were taking to\\r\\n    their nests!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 11th of July, as they were paddling down the river in search of\\r\\nthe mouth of the Wisconsin, they were startled by the sudden appearance\\r\\nof a large canoe descending rapidly upon them, containing eleven\\r\\nwarriors. They proved to be the chief Aquipaguetin, and ten of his\\r\\nbraves. This savage chieftain had been very unwilling that his adopted\\r\\nson should leave the tribe for this voyage, though the other Indians\\r\\nhad given their consent. There was a frown on his brow, and severity in\\r\\nhis tones, as he asked whether they had yet found the Frenchmen, who\\r\\nwere to bring the goods. They all landed and ate together. Then the\\r\\nchief and his party started off, leaving Father Hennepin behind, and\\r\\nwith vigorous paddling drove their canoe rapidly down the stream.\\r\\nRather menacingly the chief said that he would go to the Wisconsin\\r\\nRiver, and that if the Frenchmen were there, he would take charge of\\r\\ntheir goods.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter three days\\' absence, he again appeared, with his canoe of\\r\\nwarriors, on his return. He had been to the mouth of the river. There\\r\\nwere no signs of the Frenchmen there. He came back in a very unamiable\\r\\nmood. Father Hennepin had landed, and was alone in a frail cabin which\\r\\nhe had reared as a shelter from the hot sun. Anthony had gone into the\\r\\nprairie for food. Father Hennepin writes:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Aquipaguetin, seeing me alone, came up tomahawk in hand. I seized\\r\\n    two pocket pistols, which we had regained from the Indians, and a\\r\\n    knife. I had no intention of killing my pretended father, but only\\r\\n    wished to frighten him, and to prevent his killing me, in case he\\r\\n    had that intention.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nProbably the savage had no such murderous designs. He informed his\\r\\nadopted son that there were no Frenchmen at the Wisconsin, and none had\\r\\nbeen there, and therefore urged his return up the river. There was no\\r\\nalternative. But Father Hennepin and Anthony could not keep pace with\\r\\nthe eleven-oared, or rather paddled, canoe of the savages. They crept\\r\\nalong slowly after them. They thus paddled up the swift current of the\\r\\nMississippi two hundred miles, running the risk, Hennepin says, of\\r\\nperishing of hunger.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had but ten charges of powder left. These they divided into\\r\\ntwenty, and succeeded in killing some wild pigeons. At one time, for\\r\\ntwo days, they had no food whatever, though they landed and searched\\r\\nfor game. They found a fish whose flesh was almost putrid, dropped by\\r\\nan eagle. With bits of this they baited two hooks, which they floated\\r\\nfrom the stern of the canoe. Father Hennepin then fell upon his knees\\r\\nand prayed to St. Anthony that he would come to his relief. While\\r\\npraying, they perceived a strain upon the lines, and running to the\\r\\ncanoe, drew in two fishes, so large that they could with difficulty\\r\\ntake them from the water. They broiled pieces upon the coals, and the\\r\\nstarving men made an abundant repast.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning they met the remainder of the Indians whom they had\\r\\nleft above the Falls of St. Anthony. They were descending the river, in\\r\\nsearch of more southern hunting grounds. Michael Ako was with them. He\\r\\nhad developed want of courage and energy which excited the contempt of\\r\\nthe savages. There was a large number of canoes, composing this fleet,\\r\\ncrowded with a motley group of men, women, and children. They had\\r\\nencountered herds of buffaloes, and were well supplied with food.\\r\\n\\r\\nFather Hennepin and Anthony again joined them, and accompanied them\\r\\nback down the river, as he says, about eighty leagues. But as we have\\r\\nbefore remarked, we cannot place much reliance upon his estimate of\\r\\ndistances. The discomforts of this voyage must have been innumerable.\\r\\nThe crowded canoes, the loathsome personal habits of the savages,\\r\\nelevated but little above the beasts, the blistering midday sun, the\\r\\ndrenching storms and showers, the cheerless encampments, often upon the\\r\\nopen prairie with no protection whatever from wind and rain, and the\\r\\nfood often scanty, consisting of nothing but flesh, without any\\r\\nseasoning, boiled in earthen pots, or broiled upon the coals, must\\r\\nhave rendered the excursion irksome in the extreme to civilized men\\r\\naccustomed to the comforts of European life.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn our last chapter we left the Indians, several hundred in number, in\\r\\na fleet of canoes descending the upper waters of the Mississippi, in\\r\\nsearch of game. The three Frenchmen were with them. They were somewhere\\r\\nnear the mouth of the Wisconsin River. Conscious that they were\\r\\ntrespassing upon hunting grounds which other tribes claimed, they\\r\\npractised the utmost caution to elude their enemies. There were two\\r\\nhundred and fifty warriors, thoroughly armed with all the weapons of\\r\\nsavage warfare, who composed the guard of the tribe.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhenever they landed, they selected a spot where they could hide their\\r\\ncanoes in the tangled brush which often fringed the banks of the river.\\r\\nSome warriors were sent to the tops of the adjacent eminences to see if\\r\\nthere were any indications of hostile parties in the vicinity. They\\r\\nthen pushed back twenty or thirty miles into the prairie land, where\\r\\nthey almost invariably found herds of buffaloes grazing. Without horses\\r\\nto aid in the pursuit, and with only arrows and javelins as weapons,\\r\\nthe killing of a buffalo was indeed an arduous task. Still, in the\\r\\ncourse of a few weeks, a hundred and twenty were slaughtered. They\\r\\njerked the meat; that is, they cut it into very thin strips and hung\\r\\nthem in the sun over a smouldering fire, so that it was both smoked and\\r\\ndried at the same time.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day an Indian ran a splinter far into his foot, inflicting a very\\r\\nserious wound. Father Hennepin made a deep incision in the sole, to\\r\\ndraw out the wood. He was performing the painful operation when an\\r\\nalarm was given, that foes were approaching the camp. The wounded\\r\\nIndian immediately sprang upon his feet, seized his arms and rushed to\\r\\nmeet the enemy, regardless of his swollen, throbbing foot. The alarm\\r\\nproved a false one. A herd of eighty stags in the distance had been\\r\\nimagined to be hostile warriors. The excitement being over, it was with\\r\\nvery great difficulty the crippled savage could hobble his way back to\\r\\nthe camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Father Hennepin and Anthony Auguelle rejoined the Indians, they\\r\\nwere again separated, and each was taken into the family by which he\\r\\nhad been adopted. In their voyaging, as they passed from point to point\\r\\nin the river, there was assigned to the father the duty of conveying in\\r\\nhis small canoe, a shrivelled Indian woman, eighty years of age, and\\r\\nthree little children. These long years had not sweetened the woman\\'s\\r\\ndisposition. She was a terrible scold, and often threatened to beat the\\r\\nchildren with her paddle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus they wandered about in this successful buffalo hunt, until the\\r\\nclose of July, when they were returning to their village far up the St.\\r\\nFrancis River. They were here not very far west of the western end of\\r\\nLake Superior. As they were returning, two wandering members of the\\r\\ntribe came in, and stated that they had been to Lake Superior, that\\r\\nthey found there five Frenchmen, and that when they told them that\\r\\nthere were three of their countrymen with the Issati tribe, the\\r\\nFrenchmen were very anxious to come to them, as they could not imagine\\r\\nby what roundabout way they had reached those distant regions.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after, they met on the Mississippi River M. de Luth, with five\\r\\nFrench soldiers, descending the stream in a canoe. There is some\\r\\nconfusion in Father Hennepin\\'s narrative here, so that it is impossible\\r\\nto ascertain at what point of the river the two parties of Frenchmen\\r\\nmet. On the 14th of August they all reached the villages of the Issati.\\r\\nAs they were ascending the river they passed the grave of an Indian\\r\\nwarrior. Many of the savages cast upon it some valuable article, in\\r\\ntoken of regard for the departed. Father Hennepin, who understood the\\r\\nIndians thoroughly, spread upon it a blanket. M. Luth contributed\\r\\nnothing. The generous act of Hennepin was exceedingly gratifying to the\\r\\nIndians.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after their return, they had a great feast, Father Hennepin and\\r\\nM. Luth were both present. In the midst of the entertainment one of\\r\\nthe chiefs, who was a relative of the deceased warrior, brought in a\\r\\nlarge buffalo robe, very softly dressed, one side being brilliantly\\r\\nembroidered with variously colored porcupines\\' quills, while the curly\\r\\nwool remained upon the other. This robe was neatly folded, and upon it\\r\\nwas placed a birch-bark dish filled with food. On this, as a tea-tray,\\r\\nhe presented the dish to the father. After he had eaten the meat, the\\r\\nchief spread the robe over his shoulders, saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He whose body thou didst cover, now covers thine. He has carried\\r\\ntidings of thee to the land of spirits. Brave was thy act in his\\r\\nregard. All the nation praises thee for it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then reproached M. Luth for not having paid any tribute of respect\\r\\nto the remains of the dead. M. Luth replied that he covered the bodies\\r\\nonly of those who were chiefs, of the same rank with himself. The chief\\r\\nreplied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"PÃ¨re Louis is a greater captain than thou art; for his robe is more\\r\\nbeautiful than thine. We have sent his robe to our allies who are\\r\\ndistant more than three moons\\' journey from our country.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBy his _robe_ the chief meant the rich dress, embroidered with silver\\r\\nlace, which the ecclesiastic wore at mass, and which he called his\\r\\n\"brocade chasuble.\" This garment had so dazzled the eyes of the\\r\\nIndians, that they had appropriated it to themselves as of supernatural\\r\\nsplendor.\\r\\n\\r\\nToward the end of September, Father Hennepin informed the Indians that\\r\\nit was his wish and that of his two companions, to return with the five\\r\\nother Frenchmen to their own country; and that then they would fit out\\r\\nexpeditions laden with goods to trade with these distant tribes. The\\r\\nIndians gave their consent. The length of the journey to Montreal by\\r\\nthe route they must take, they estimated at twenty-four hundred miles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eight Frenchmen set out in two canoes. They paddled down the St.\\r\\nFrancis, and the Mississippi to the mouth of the Wisconsin. On their\\r\\nway they met a fleet of one hundred and forty canoes, filled with about\\r\\ntwo hundred and fifty warriors. The chiefs visited the Frenchmen, and\\r\\ntreated them with greatest kindness.\\r\\n\\r\\nEntering the Wisconsin, they paddled up its lone and silent banks one\\r\\nhundred and twenty miles, as they supposed. They followed the same\\r\\nroute which Father Marquette had previously pursued going in an\\r\\nopposite direction. They carried their canoes and their effects on\\r\\ntheir shoulders, across a portage of a mile and a half to Fox River.\\r\\nHere they reÃ«mbarked, following a river of wonderful windings, and\\r\\nthrough a series of magnificent and beautiful lakes, and through a\\r\\ncountry which they described as charming in the extreme, until they\\r\\nentered the magnificent expanse of Green Bay, at its southern\\r\\nextremity. They had accomplished, as they judged, about twelve hundred\\r\\nmiles of their journey. Father Hennepin writes:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"I had not celebrated mass for over nine months, for want of wine.\\r\\n    I had still some hosts. We remained two days to rest, sing the Te\\r\\n    Deum, high mass, and preach. All our Frenchmen went to confession\\r\\n    and communion, to thank God for having preserved us amid so many\\r\\n    wanderings and perils.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey purchased for a gun, a canoe, large enough to contain them all.\\r\\nWith this they paddled a hundred leagues, until they reached Mackinac.\\r\\nThe blasts of approaching winter were beginning to sweep these cold\\r\\nregions. Here they spent the winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this point they found, as they expected, an important military and\\r\\ntrading post. Many Indians, even from remote tribes, were continually\\r\\ncoming and going. Father Hennepin engaged very earnestly in preaching\\r\\nto the French, and in trying to teach the Indians the Gospel of Christ.\\r\\nThey were deeply impressed with the heroism he had exhibited in his\\r\\nlong and perilous journey. They said that the father must have been\\r\\nprotected by the Great Spirit, for had any of the Indians attempted to\\r\\ngo so far they would certainly have been put to death by these distant\\r\\ntribes.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in April, 1681, the father, with a few boatmen, set out on his\\r\\nlong voyage to Fort Frontenac, at the extreme end of Lake Ontario. A\\r\\nbroad belt of thick ice still fringed the shores of these northern\\r\\nlakes. For thirty miles they dragged their canoes over the ice of Lake\\r\\nHuron; and then, as they came to thin ice, launched them upon this\\r\\nfresh water sea. They sailed along the lake a \"hundred leagues,\"\\r\\nclosely following the shore, landing every night, and living mainly\\r\\nupon white-fish, which were caught in abundance, in twenty fathoms\\r\\nwater. They passed \"The Strait\" and Lake St. Clair for \"thirty\\r\\nleagues.\" In the still waters of Lake St. Clair they killed with an\\r\\naxe, thirty sturgeons which had come to the shallow waters of the banks\\r\\nto spawn. Near this place they came upon an Ottowa Indian chief, wan\\r\\nand woe-stricken, who told him that he had been unsuccessful in\\r\\nhunting, and his wife and five children had all starved to death.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmerging from \"The Strait,\" they entered Lake Erie, and paddled along\\r\\nits shores a hundred and twenty leagues. Carrying their canoes and\\r\\neffects upon their backs, they passed the great Falls of Niagara, and\\r\\nagain took to the water, coasting along the southern shore of Lake\\r\\nOntario. After a voyage of about ninety miles, they reached a large\\r\\nvillage of Seneca Indians, on the southern shore of the lake. It was\\r\\nthe middle of May. These Indians had constant intercourse with the\\r\\nFrench in Canada, and were in cordial alliance with them. Father\\r\\nHennepin attended a council of the chiefs, accusing them of having\\r\\nenslaved, as he had learned by the way, several Indians of the Ottawa\\r\\ntribe, who were also allies of the French. The chiefs made many\\r\\napologies; said that the deed had been perpetrated by some mad young\\r\\nwarriors, and that the captives should be restored to their tribe.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the chiefs, named Teganeot, speaking in the name of all\\r\\nassembled in the council, presented Father Hennepin with several rich\\r\\nfurs, which were valued at about twenty-five dollars. The father\\r\\naccepted the gift, but immediately passed it over to the son of the\\r\\nchief, saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I give it to you, that you may purchase such things as you need of the\\r\\nFrench traders. I cannot accept any presents. But I will report your\\r\\nkind feelings to the French Governor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nReÃ«mbarking, they continued their voyage forty leagues, when they\\r\\nreached Fort Frontenac. Father Hennepin was received with great\\r\\nrejoicing, as one risen from the dead. After a short tarry, they again\\r\\nentered their canoes, and descending the rapids of the St. Lawrence, in\\r\\ntwo days reached Montreal, sixty miles distant from the fort. Here\\r\\nCount Frontenac resided. He was Governor of all the French possessions\\r\\nin the New World.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This governor,\" Father Hennepin writes, \"received me as well as a man\\r\\nof his probity can receive a missionary. As he believed me killed by\\r\\nthe Indians, he was for a time thunderstruck. He beheld me wasted,\\r\\nwithout a cloak, with a garment patched with pieces of buffalo skin. He\\r\\ntook me with him, twelve days, to recover, and himself gave me the meat\\r\\nI was to eat, for fear I should eat too much, after so long a diet. I\\r\\nrendered to him an exact account of my voyage, and represented to him\\r\\nthe advantages of our discovery.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IX.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The Abandonment of Fort CrÃ¨vecoeur._\\r\\n\\r\\nDeparture of La Salle. Fathers MembrÃ© and Gabriel. Their Missionary\\r\\nLabors. Character of the Savages. The Iroquois on the War Path. Peril\\r\\nof the Garrison. Heroism of Tonti and MembrÃ©. Infamous Conduct of the\\r\\nYoung Savages. Flight of the Illinois. Fort Abandoned. Death of Father\\r\\nGabriel. Sufferings of the Journey to Mackinac.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will be remembered that on the last of February, 1680, M. La Salle\\r\\nleft the fort at CrÃ¨vecoeur, with four Frenchmen and an Indian guide,\\r\\nfor his perilous journey of four hundred leagues, through the pathless\\r\\nwilderness, to Frontenac, at the eastern extremity of Lake Ontario. His\\r\\nchosen companion, Lieutenant Tonti, was intrusted with the military\\r\\ncharge of the garrison. Fathers MembrÃ© and Gabriel, both inspired with\\r\\nthe noblest spirit of missionary enterprise, were appointed to instruct\\r\\nand, if possible, to convert the Indians.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey raised a pretty capacious log-cabin, which was both their\\r\\nresidence and their chapel. This humble sanctuary was every day crowded\\r\\nwith Indians from various tribes. A very large Indian village was on\\r\\nthe shores of Lake Peoria, about half a mile from the cabin of the\\r\\nmissionaries. Father MembrÃ©, a true apostle of Jesus Christ, wrote an\\r\\naccount of the momentous scenes which transpired. To his narrative we\\r\\nare indebted for the facts which we now give.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the chiefs, Oumakouka, adopted, according to Indian custom,\\r\\nFather MembrÃ© as his son. He ever welcomed him to a warm seat by his\\r\\nwigwam fire, and presented him with tender morsels of game. While\\r\\nFather Gabriel spent the most of his time in the fort with Lieutenant\\r\\nTonti and the workmen, Father MembrÃ©, who was soon quite familiar with\\r\\ntheir language, devoted much of his time to the instruction of the\\r\\nIndians in their wigwams. This was the arrangement which La Salle had\\r\\nmade. He felt that the wild and reckless spirits in the garrison needed\\r\\nthe restraints of the constant presence of their spiritual father.\\r\\nIndividuals might otherwise be guilty of violating the rights of the\\r\\nIndians, and thus the whole of the little community might be involved\\r\\nin ruin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe large Indian village where Father MembrÃ© exerted his ministry\\r\\ncontained a population of about eight thousand souls. There were also a\\r\\nlarge number of villages within a circle of fifty miles in diameter,\\r\\nsome of which belonged to other tribes. These the unwearied missionary\\r\\nfrequently visited. All these Indians made their wigwams of mats of\\r\\nbraided flat rushes. They were tall, well formed, and very skilful\\r\\narchers. But the good father does not give a very flattering account of\\r\\nthe characters they developed. They were genuine loafers; idle,\\r\\nexcessively superstitious, quarrelsome, under scarcely any restraints\\r\\nof law, and they would steal everything upon which they could lay their\\r\\nhands. Their lands were exceedingly fertile that, with very slight\\r\\nlabor, they had an abundance of corn. Pounded corn, mixed with water\\r\\nand baked in the ashes, would afford but a meagre repast in the\\r\\nhumblest log-cabin. It was deemed all-sufficient in the wigwam.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll who could afford it had several wives. They were as unfeeling as\\r\\nbrutes. If a wife displeased her lord and master, he would mercilessly\\r\\ncut off her nose; and with apparently as little concern as a\\r\\ndog-fancier trims the ears of a terrier. United with these execrable\\r\\ntraits of character, there were others, to which we have already\\r\\nalluded, which were alluring. In the summer, the men often went without\\r\\nany clothing, except moccasins made of buffalo hide.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese poor savages were engaged in almost incessant wars. Even the\\r\\nreligion of Jesus, whose great mission was to bring peace on earth and\\r\\ngoodwill to man, has not yet been able to obliterate these sanguinary\\r\\npropensities from the human heart. England, France, Germany, are great\\r\\nslaughterhouses, where millions of men have hurled themselves upon each\\r\\nother in demoniac strife. What, then, could be expected of savages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Miamis of the north were organizing an expedition against the\\r\\nIllinois. The rumor reached the Indian village at CrÃ¨vecoeur, and\\r\\ncreated great consternation. Lieutenant Tonti endeavored to inspire the\\r\\nIndians with a spirit of defence. He taught them how to surround their\\r\\nvillage with palisades, and influenced them to build a fort with\\r\\nintrenchments. Some of the French garrison, weary of the restraints of\\r\\nthe fort, deserted, and wandered away among the Indian tribes; and so\\r\\nincorporated themselves with the savages, in dress, in war-paint, in\\r\\nhabits, and in taking Indian wives, that it required very close\\r\\nscrutiny to distinguish them from the Indians.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two missionaries, conscious that there was no substantial remedy\\r\\nfor the ills of humanity but in the regeneration of the soul which the\\r\\nreligion of Jesus enjoined, consecrated, with increasing zeal, all\\r\\ntheir energies in the endeavor to make Frenchmen and Indians good men,\\r\\nnew creatures in Jesus Christ.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the Illinois chiefs, Asapista by name, became very strongly\\r\\nattached to good Father Gabriel, and adopted him as his son. This was\\r\\nquite a favor. The generality of the Indians, like the populace\\r\\neverywhere, were exceedingly fickle. The friendship and caresses of\\r\\nto-day might be hatred and the tomahawk to-morrow. The adoption of a\\r\\nstranger into the tribe, as the son of a chief, was a great security\\r\\nagainst any sudden outburst of suspicion, which might lead to massacre.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gospel of Christ makes slow headway against the wickedness of man.\\r\\nAs in our own enlightened times, the multitude listened, were\\r\\nrespectful to their teachers, even reverenced them, but did not heed or\\r\\nobey.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With regard to conversions,\" Father MembrÃ© writes, \"I cannot rely on\\r\\nany. There is in these savages such an alienation from the faith, so\\r\\nbrutal and narrow a mind, such corrupt and anti-Christian morals, that\\r\\nmuch time would be needed to hope for any fruit. It is however true,\\r\\nthat I found many of quite docile character. We baptized some dying\\r\\nchildren, and two or three dying persons who manifested proper\\r\\ndispositions. As these people are entirely material in their ideas,\\r\\nthey would have submitted to baptism, had we liked, but without any\\r\\nknowledge of the sacrament.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the summer, the Indians wandered about in large hunting\\r\\nexpeditions. The missionaries accompanied these bands, seeking day by\\r\\nday opportunities to teach them. Father MembrÃ© also visited several\\r\\nremote tribes. He found much to discourage him. He said that their\\r\\nblindness and obduracy were quite indescribable.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 10th of September, 1680, when the Indians had generally returned\\r\\nfrom their hunting parties, and were loitering about in indolent\\r\\ngroups, with nothing to do, an Indian, from an allied tribe, came\\r\\nrushing almost breathless into the village, with the tidings that a\\r\\nunited army of the Iroquois and the Miamis from the north, five hundred\\r\\nin number, had already entered their territory, and were on the rapid\\r\\nmarch to attack their village by surprise. He also made the astounding\\r\\nassertion that M. La Salle himself was leading this band of hostile\\r\\nwarriors. There was no foundation for this last statement excepting\\r\\nthat the chief of the Iroquois wore a European coat and hat. This led\\r\\nthe courier to think he was La Salle, whom he had seen similarly\\r\\ndressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indians, accepting this statement, of course believed that there\\r\\nwas treachery. Supposing the Frenchmen at CrÃ¨vecoeur were prepared to\\r\\njoin the invading army immediately upon its arrival, they resolved to\\r\\ntomahawk them all. The peril of the French was great. The Indians, like\\r\\nchildren, were apt to act first and think afterwards. The French were\\r\\nentirely unprepared for such a sudden change of feeling.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Lieutenant Tonti, whose presence of mind never forsook him even in\\r\\nthe greatest perils, ran from the fort to the village, and assured the\\r\\nwarriors that La Salle was not with their foes, and that he was ready\\r\\nto muster his whole force, at the garrison, with their fire-arms, and\\r\\naccompany the warriors to repel the enemy. This caused another change\\r\\nof public sentiment. All looked to the French as their deliverers. In a\\r\\nfew hours several hundred warriors, with the French, were on the march.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe arrow from the bow is but a feeble weapon compared with the bullet\\r\\nfrom rifle. The Iroquois, having had much intercourse with the French\\r\\nin Canada, were many of them supplied with fire-arms. They were allies\\r\\nof the French, and were very anxious to preserve friendship with them.\\r\\nThe Illinois Indians, being more remote, had not been able to obtain\\r\\nthe efficient European instruments of warfare.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two parties approached each other; and the Illinois, guided by\\r\\nTonti, were placed in a commanding position to resist attack. The\\r\\nallies were much disappointed in finding their plan of assailing the\\r\\nvillage by surprise frustrated. They paused in the march; and the two\\r\\narmies for some time looked each other in the face, neither venturing\\r\\nto commence the assault. The result of the battle was at least\\r\\ndoubtful. So many of the Iroquois warriors were armed with muskets or\\r\\nrifles, and had become so skilful in the use of them that, in Indian\\r\\nwarfare, dodging from rock to rock and from tree to tree, they were\\r\\nfully equal to the French. Whatever might be the result of the battle,\\r\\nit was certain that many on each side must be slain.\\r\\n\\r\\nLieutenant Tonti called the chiefs of the Illinois around him, and,\\r\\nafter quite an earnest colloquy, induced them to consent that he should\\r\\ngo to the Iroquois chiefs and endeavor to avert hostilities. It was a\\r\\nperilous enterprise. While some of the Indian chieftains were of much\\r\\nmoral worth, there were many savages who were miserable wretches, and\\r\\nover whom the chiefs had but very little control.\\r\\n\\r\\nLieutenant Tonti, partly from necessity, partly from choice, was\\r\\ndressed mainly in Indian costume. As the European garments of the\\r\\nFrenchmen were worn out, they were constrained to supply their place\\r\\nwith deer-skin jackets and leggins, generally painted and fringed after\\r\\nthe fashion of the natives. Thus Lieutenant Tonti, at the council of\\r\\nthe chiefs, in general appearance resembled the rest. But the Christian\\r\\nFathers always wore a long black gown. As we have mentioned, they were\\r\\ncalled by that name among all the tribes, \"The Black Gowns.\" Their\\r\\nteachings, their ministerings at the couches of the sick and dying,\\r\\ntheir utter renunciation of the character of warriors, and their\\r\\nself-denying devotion to the welfare of the Indians, had caused them to\\r\\nbe generally revered. But, among the untutored tribes as in almost\\r\\nevery village of our land, there were \"certain lewd fellows of the\\r\\nbaser sort,\" who hated the clergy.\\r\\n\\r\\nFather MembrÃ©, with that calm, peaceful Christian chivalry which cannot\\r\\nbe surpassed amidst the tumult and carnage of the field of battle,\\r\\noffered to accompany Lieutenant Tonti on his mission of peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two opposing forces were facing each other, with the space of\\r\\nperhaps an eighth of a mile between them. Both parties were concealed,\\r\\nas far as possible, though occasionally the nodding plumes of a warrior\\r\\nwere visible, as he moved from one hiding-place to another. Lieutenant\\r\\nTonti, holding high above his head, as a flag of truce, the gorgeously\\r\\ndecorated calumet of peace, accompanied by Father MembrÃ© in his long,\\r\\nflowing black robe, boldly moved forward toward the Iroquois\\r\\nencampment. Several of the chiefs met him, and were surprised to find\\r\\nthat he was a Frenchman. He addressed them in their own language, in\\r\\nsubstance as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I bring you the calumet of peace. The Illinois, against whom you are\\r\\nwaging war, are our brothers. They are the friends and allies of the\\r\\nFrench. The great father in Canada is the protector both of the\\r\\nIroquois and of the Illinois. He cannot see one destroy the other.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chiefs were deeply impressed by this statement. It would be ruinous\\r\\nfor them to bring down the terrible arm of the French power upon their\\r\\nnation. The French could withhold entirely from them arms and\\r\\nammunition, and could supply their foes abundantly with these terrible\\r\\nmaterials of war. Such were the thoughts of the considerate chieftains.\\r\\nThey perceived the necessity of heeding the remonstrance. But the\\r\\nreckless young men, who had their reputation as warriors to make, and\\r\\nwhose hearts were glowing with the thought of returning to their\\r\\nvillage waving gory scalps as the trophies of their heroism, were\\r\\nresolved that there should be no peace. To render a battle inevitable\\r\\nthey determined to kill the two envoys from the Illinois camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nA small band of these ferocious, savage young men, crept up, cautiously\\r\\nand unperceived, to a spot within arrow-shot of the place where the\\r\\nconference with the chiefs was held. Suddenly they discharged several\\r\\narrows upon Tonti and MembrÃ©, which whizzed by, fortunately, without\\r\\nhitting them. The perfidious wretches then rushed forward, with\\r\\ngleaming knives. The chiefs interposed to save those who were under the\\r\\nsacred protection of the calumet.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne young Indian, with vigorous arm and a gleaming knife, aimed a blow\\r\\nat the heart of Lieutenant Tonti. As by a miracle, he escaped from\\r\\ndeath. The blow struck him to the ground, and the blood gushed forth\\r\\nfrom a fearful gash. But the point of the knife glanced from a rib, and\\r\\ndid not penetrate the heart. All this was the work of an instant. The\\r\\nchiefs, veteran warriors, who had a reputation for honor to sustain,\\r\\npromptly drew their knives, surrounded the envoys with their\\r\\nprotection, and drove off the assassins. Tenderly they bound up the\\r\\nwound of Tonti, expressed to him their grief and indignation, assured\\r\\nhim that hostilities should cease and that they would immediately\\r\\nwithdraw, with their warriors, back to their own village.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wounded lieutenant, aided by his clerical friend, returned to the\\r\\nIllinois camp, with the glad tidings that the Iroquois had consented to\\r\\npeace. Several hours passed, and the Iroquois bands, instead of\\r\\nretiring, were continually drawing nearer, in a very suspicious manner,\\r\\napparently with the intention of surrounding the Illinois, and cutting\\r\\noff their retreat. The Illinois chief held another council, and\\r\\nrequested Father MembrÃ© to go back to the Iroquois and inquire into the\\r\\nreason of their conduct. Father MembrÃ© writes:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"This was not a very agreeable mission to a savage tribe.\\r\\n    Nevertheless, I made up my mind, and God preserved me from all\\r\\n    harm.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chiefs received him kindly. They were ashamed of the course which\\r\\nthe warriors, notwithstanding their remonstrances, were pursuing. They\\r\\nsaid to him frankly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Our real trouble is that we are starving. We expected to find abundant\\r\\nfood in the Illinois village, and have consumed all we brought with us.\\r\\nOur march has frightened away the game, so that we can expect to find\\r\\nbut little on our return. We are in danger of perishing for want of\\r\\nfood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMembrÃ© brought back this message. At his suggestion an abundance of\\r\\nfood was immediately sent, on many heavily-laden shoulders, to the\\r\\nIllinois camp. The good father accompanied this peaceful embassage, and\\r\\nslept in the camp of the Illinois. Still the young savages were\\r\\ndetermined, if possible, to bring on a fight. They longed for the\\r\\nexcitement of battle. The hideous war-whoop, with the shrieks of women\\r\\nand children, falling beneath their tomahawks, was music to their ears.\\r\\nThe burning wigwams, the mangled bodies, the bloody scalps, were\\r\\npictures of beauty to their eyes. And, most glorious of all, to their\\r\\npurely unangelic natures, was the triumphant return to their village\\r\\nwith prisoners to run the dreadful gauntlet; and to writhe, and perhaps\\r\\nbe forced to scream, beneath the fiend-like tortures of the stake.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning the Iroquois warriors, instead of turning their steps\\r\\nhomewards, flocked, in large numbers, into the village of the Illinois.\\r\\nThey were evidently bent upon picking a quarrel. They swaggered through\\r\\nthe streets, insulted the women, trampled the corn-fields, and went\\r\\neven so far as to disinter, and knock about the bones of the dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt soon became manifest to all, that a bloody conflict was inevitable.\\r\\nThe chiefs directed all the women and children to retire as silently\\r\\nand unobserved as possible, and hide themselves in the forest, behind a\\r\\ndistant hill. Here they were in the vicinity of a trail which led quite\\r\\ndirectly to the Mississippi River. If the Illinois were defeated in the\\r\\nbattle, they could by this line of retreat, cross the Great River, and\\r\\ntake refuge with a friendly tribe upon the other side. Then the\\r\\nIllinois warriors, in a body, without venturing upon an engagement\\r\\nabandoned the village to the Iroquois, and commenced a precipitate\\r\\nflight to the Mississippi. They were not pursued. The Iroquois chiefs\\r\\nwould not lead the young men in an enterprise which they deemed so\\r\\ndishonorable.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we have said, the control of the chiefs over the daring and lawless\\r\\nspirits of the young savages was feeble. The French garrison was\\r\\ngreatly weakened by death and desertion. There was much reason to fear\\r\\nthat the savages would fall upon them, and kill them all, for the sake\\r\\nof the plunder they would find in the fort. There was nothing to detain\\r\\nthe missionaries. Upon the retirement of the Iroquois, they would be\\r\\nleft in a lone and silent wilderness.\\r\\n\\r\\nLieutenant Tonti, and his two clerical associates, Fathers MembrÃ© and\\r\\nGabriel, held a consultation, and decided upon an immediate withdrawal.\\r\\nIt was the 13th of September, 1680. Their desire was to go back to\\r\\nMackinaw, which station La Salle would necessarily revisit on his\\r\\nreturn from Frontenac, with reinforcements and supplies. Their numbers\\r\\nwere so diminished, and their departure so hasty, that they all\\r\\nembarked in one frail canoe. The chiefs so far restrained the young\\r\\nsavages, that no attack was made upon them. But the leaders of this\\r\\nfeeble little garrison were well aware, that in all probability bands\\r\\nof the young men would pursue them, to lie in ambush at some narrow\\r\\npassage of the river, and cut them off, if possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey left the fort about noon, packing in their canoe only a few\\r\\narticles of absolute necessity. All the afternoon they plied their\\r\\npaddles vigorously, ascending the Illinois River, and passing through\\r\\nthe broad expanse of Lake Peoria. Their canoe was leaky and heavily\\r\\nladen. The current was strong, and their passage slow. They did not\\r\\nventure to land until after dark, that the landing might not be seen by\\r\\nany foe, skulking through the forest along the banks of the river. They\\r\\nalso took the precaution to seek their night\\'s encampment on the side\\r\\nof the stream opposite that which was occupied by the Iroquois band.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt an early hour the next morning they resumed their voyage, still\\r\\nascending the Illinois River. They had paddled along but a few hours,\\r\\nand had reached a point between twenty-five and thirty miles above the\\r\\nfort, when their dilapidated canoe leaked so badly, that they were\\r\\nforced to land, that they might repair it. They were on the borders of\\r\\none of Illinois\\' most beautiful prairies. The smooth and verdant\\r\\nexpanse, extending to the horizon, was dotted with groves, presenting a\\r\\nlandscape of enchanting loveliness.\\r\\n\\r\\nFather Gabriel, as he could be of no service in repairing the boat,\\r\\ndecided to walk into one of the groves at a little distance from the\\r\\nriver, with his prayer-book in his hand, that he might, alone in those\\r\\nlonely solitudes, worship his Creator. It was a temple for devout\\r\\nmeditation and adoration such as no cathedral reared by man\\'s hand ever\\r\\npresented.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt took all day to repair the canoe. Hour after hour passed away, and\\r\\nFather Gabriel did not return. His companions began to feel a little\\r\\nsolicitude about his safety. Toward evening Father MembrÃ© set out in\\r\\nsearch of him. He was not in the grove. There were no traces of him to\\r\\nbe seen. There were several groves in the distance; and there were\\r\\ngentle eminences in the rolling prairie, behind which he might be\\r\\nconcealed. The anxious father ascended one after another of these\\r\\neminences, but nowhere over the vast plain could he catch any sight of\\r\\nthe lost one. Again and again he shouted. The silence of the prairie\\r\\nwas the only response to his cry.\\r\\n\\r\\nGreatly alarmed, he returned to his companions, who had now completed\\r\\ntheir repairs of the canoe. The whole party then set out on the search.\\r\\nThey moved in various directions; hallooed, and fired their guns. All\\r\\nwas in vain. Night had settled over the prairie, when they reassembled\\r\\nin great despondency at the canoe. Father Gabriel was greatly loved. He\\r\\nwas a gentle, self-sacrificing man, of kindly words and generous deeds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe party crossed the river, as a precaution against an attack from any\\r\\nband of the Iroquois who might be following them. They then built a\\r\\nlarge fire, that its rays, shining far and wide over the prairie, might\\r\\narrest the eye of the lost one, and guide him on his return. The\\r\\nmorning dawned. Still there was no clue to the disappearance of Father\\r\\nGabriel. The voyagers returned to the other side of the river, and\\r\\nlingered there until the middle of the forenoon.\\r\\n\\r\\nLieutenant Tonti then said that it was clear that their companion had\\r\\nnot wandered into the prairie and become lost; for from any of the\\r\\neminences he could have discerned the line of the river, nor could he\\r\\nhave wandered so far as neither to have heard the report of their guns\\r\\nnor seen the light of their fire. It was certain that he had either\\r\\nbeen cut off by some prowling band of savages, or that he had decided\\r\\nto follow up the banks of the river on foot, intending to enter the\\r\\ncanoe when it came along. In either case it was their duty to press\\r\\nforward on their journey as rapidly as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a long time they heard no more of Father Gabriel. Finally they\\r\\nlearned that some young savages, of the Kikapoo tribe, who were at war\\r\\nwith the Iroquois, were prowling about when they caught sight of the\\r\\nfather engaged in his devotions in the grove. His eyes were probably\\r\\nclosed, and his whole soul absorbed in prayer. There is one advantage\\r\\nwhich the arrow has over the bullet. It performs its deadly mission\\r\\nwithout making any noise. The wily savages, unseen and unheard, crept\\r\\nnear, and piercing him with their arrows he fell dead. They took his\\r\\nscalp, threw the body into a ditch, covering it with a few leaves, and\\r\\nfled. When they arrived at their village they very boastfully exhibited\\r\\nthe scalp of the defenceless missionary, as that of an Iroquois\\r\\nwarrior. To obtain this renown was the only object of the cowardly\\r\\nassassins in their murderous deed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus died Father Gabriel. He was the last scion of a noble family of\\r\\nBurgundy. He had renounced his inheritance, and all the brilliant\\r\\nprospects of a courtly life, to consecrate himself to the service of\\r\\nhis Saviour, the Son of God. In his own country, his family name, his\\r\\nmany virtues, and his entire devotion to the ministry upon which he had\\r\\nentered, had elevated him to high positions of influence and honor. All\\r\\nthese he relinquished, after he had passed his three-score years, to\\r\\nproclaim the Gospel of Jesus to the savages of North America. He landed\\r\\nin Canada, in the summer of 1670. For some time he was employed as\\r\\nchaplain of Governor Frontenac. Here he was untiring in his efforts to\\r\\ninstruct the Indians. Having become in a good degree familiar with\\r\\ntheir language and customs, he embarked with La Salle to establish new\\r\\nmissions in the vast and unexplored regions he was about to penetrate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good old man was now seventy years of age. For forty years he had\\r\\nbeen earnestly engaged in preaching the gospel of peace on earth, and\\r\\ngood will among men. And now the blessed hour had come when God sent\\r\\nhis angel to take the victor in many a hard-fought spiritual conflict,\\r\\nto his home in heaven; for God can convert even the wickedness of man\\r\\ninto an agency for the accomplishment of His purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow sublime the scene of his departure. It was a serene, beautiful\\r\\nautumnal day. The deep blue of the overarching skies were embroidered,\\r\\nas it were, with fleecy clouds. The waters of the river, clear as\\r\\ncrystal, flowed gently by. The luxuriant prairie, brilliant with the\\r\\nbloom of autumn, almost entranced the eye as a garden of the Lord. In a\\r\\nmajestic grove the veteran Christian knelt, at peace with God, with\\r\\nhimself, and with all the world. His eyes were closed. His hands were\\r\\nclasped. His soul was all absorbed in prayer. Suddenly a shower of\\r\\narrows pierce him, and he falls dead!\\r\\n\\r\\nDead! do I say? No! He awakes to a new life of inconceivable vitality\\r\\nand grandeur. A retinue of angels are there, ready to receive him. In\\r\\ntheir blest companionship he takes his rapturous journey to the bosom\\r\\nof his Saviour and his God.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Oh, \\'tis a glorious thing to die\\r\\n    As dies the Christian, with his armor on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe saddened voyagers, as they plied their paddles in ascending the\\r\\nriver, all unconscious of the fate which had overtaken the beloved\\r\\nfather, had still a journey of nearly two hundred and fifty miles\\r\\nbefore them, ere they could reach their friends. The dilapidated canoe\\r\\nsoon failed them entirely, and they were compelled to abandon it. The\\r\\nremainder of the long journey was to be made on foot. Their destitution\\r\\nwas alarming. They had no food but such as they could pick up by the\\r\\nway. Their clothing was old, worn out, and very scant; for they had\\r\\nbeen waiting for supplies to be brought them by La Salle. They had\\r\\nneither companion nor guide. The route they were to follow was in a\\r\\nnortherly direction through the pathless forests, and over the pathless\\r\\nprairies, many miles west of Lake Michigan, to the missionary station\\r\\nat the foot of Green Bay.\\r\\n\\r\\nFather Hennepin had left his cloak in the canoe. They cut up the\\r\\ngarment to repair their shoes and clothes. Often, in days of storm,\\r\\nthey wandered bewildered and lost. They found but little game, for they\\r\\nwere not professional hunters. Their food consisted mainly of acorns\\r\\nand roots. After a journey of fifteen days, and when almost starved,\\r\\nthey were so fortunate as to kill a deer. Upon venison steaks they\\r\\nfeasted luxuriously.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length they came to a little cluster of Pottawatomi wigwams. This\\r\\npowerful tribe occupied an extensive territory southwest of Lake\\r\\nMichigan. About ten years before, a delegation from the tribe had\\r\\nvisited the French, and friendly relations were established between\\r\\nthem. Very hospitably they received the worn, emaciate, and ragged\\r\\nwanderers. They fed them with such morsels as could be fished from the\\r\\npots of the Indians. The wigwams were comfortable, affording ample\\r\\nprotection from wind and rain. The weary wanderers, who were scarcely\\r\\nable to stand, threw themselves upon mats before the wigwam fires and\\r\\nslept long, long hours of rich enjoyment.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomewhat recruited by the repose of a few days, they again took up\\r\\ntheir line of march. After the endurance of great fatigue and many\\r\\nsufferings, they at length reached the missionary station at Green Bay.\\r\\nHere they were received as brothers, and here they passed the winter.\\r\\nEarly in the spring, as soon as the ice had disappeared from the bay,\\r\\nLieutenant Tonti and Father MembrÃ© set out in a canoe, with a few\\r\\nboatmen, for the station at Michilimackinac. After a prosperous voyage\\r\\nof a few days, they reached that important point in safety. They had\\r\\nbeen there but a short time, when a small fleet of canoes came paddling\\r\\ninto the harbor. It was about the middle of June. To their great joy\\r\\nthey found that it was an expedition of La Salle, and that he was on\\r\\nboard. He had a sad story to tell of disasters and sufferings, which we\\r\\nmust reserve for our next chapter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER X.\\r\\n\\r\\n_La Salle\\'s Second Exploring Tour._\\r\\n\\r\\nDisasters. Energy of La Salle. The Embarcation. Navigating the Lakes.\\r\\nSunshine and Storm, Beauty and Desolation. Ruins at CrÃ¨vecoeur. Steps\\r\\nRetraced. Christian Character of La Salle. Arrival at Mackinaw. The\\r\\nEnterprise Renewed. Travelling on the Ice. Descent of the Illinois\\r\\nRiver. Entering the Mississippi. Voyage of the Canoes. Adventures with\\r\\nthe Indians.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will be remembered that late in February, 1680, La Salle left\\r\\nCrÃ¨vecoeur for Frontenac, to obtain supplies. We have no record of\\r\\nthe details of that wonderful journey of four hundred leagues through\\r\\nthe wilderness. He reached the post after a long and exhausting\\r\\njourney. There he encountered tidings of disaster sufficient to crush\\r\\nthe stoutest heart. The Griffin had foundered, when but a few days out\\r\\nfrom Green Bay. All on board perished; and the whole of La Salle\\'s\\r\\nfortune, consisting of ten thousand dollars\\' worth of furs, had gone\\r\\ndown into the bottom of the lake.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rumor reached Frontenac that La Salle had perished in his vessel.\\r\\nHe had sent quite a fleet of canoes, laden with articles for the Indian\\r\\ntrade, to purchase all the furs they could along the northern and\\r\\nsouthern shores of Lake Ontario. The canoe men heard the rumor of the\\r\\ndeath of La Salle, and treacherously appropriated to themselves all the\\r\\ngoods with which they had been intrusted. Before setting out on his\\r\\nfirst excursion, he had sent to France for more goods, to the amount of\\r\\nfive thousand dollars; a very considerable sum in those days. The\\r\\nvessel laden with these articles, after having safely crossed the\\r\\nAtlantic, was driven upon one of the islands of St. Peter, and\\r\\neverything was lost. There was no insurance in those days; La Salle did\\r\\nindeed experience the truth of the adage that \"sorrows come in troops.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStill the enterprise, energy, and noble character of the man was such\\r\\nthat friends came to the rescue. The Governor was very desirous of\\r\\ncontinuing the exploration, to the mouth of the Mississippi, which La\\r\\nSalle had begun. It was his great ambition there to unfurl the banner\\r\\nof France, and there, in the name of his king, to take possession of\\r\\nthe most majestic valley on this globe.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother small fleet of canoes was soon prepared, freighted with such\\r\\narticles, for use and traffic, as he would need on the expedition. The\\r\\ncanoes, eight or ten in number, were large and strong. The party\\r\\nconsisted of twenty-three Frenchmen and thirty-one Indians; fifty-four,\\r\\nin all. The statement seems almost incredible that, of these Indians,\\r\\nten were women, and three were children. But Father Zenobe, who\\r\\naccompanied the expedition, mentions that the Indians insisted upon\\r\\ntaking the women, as servants, to cook their food, and to perform the\\r\\ndrudgery at their several encampments. Some of these women had children\\r\\nwhom they could not leave behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was indeed an imposing spectacle, when, at an early hour of a still,\\r\\nsultry summer morning, this gayly decorated fleet of canoes pushed out\\r\\nfrom the little harbor at the fort, upon the mirrored surface of Lake\\r\\nOntario. It was, to a considerable degree, a national expedition. The\\r\\nbanners of France fluttered in the gentle breeze over all the\\r\\nbattlements of the fort. The forests and the hills resounded with the\\r\\nroar of the salute from her heavy guns. Hundreds of Indians crowded the\\r\\nshore to witness the departure. The Frenchmen returned the salute by a\\r\\ndischarge of their muskets and by three cheers. The canoes speedily\\r\\ndisappeared behind a headland, as the voyagers, with their paddles,\\r\\npressed forward upon one of the most extraordinary expeditions ever\\r\\nundertaken by man.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe voyage along the southern shore of the lake proved to be very\\r\\nstormy. Again and again the gale and the surging billows drove them\\r\\nashore. To the Indians, and to the Canadian boatmen generally, there\\r\\nwas no hardship in this. It was the customary life of these men; and to\\r\\nthe Indians, the life to which they had been inured from infancy, and\\r\\nthe only life they had ever known. Indeed the crew generally had no\\r\\nmore thought of yesterday or tomorrow than the few dogs who accompanied\\r\\nthem. The weight of responsibility rested only upon the minds of La\\r\\nSalle and his gentlemanly, highly educated ecclesiastical companions.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen landing, for an encampment at night, or forced to take shelter\\r\\nfrom the storm, they easily drew their canoes up upon the greensward;\\r\\nturned them over to protect the freight from the rain, entered a little\\r\\ndistance, the dense, primeval forest, which from time immemorial had\\r\\nfringed the shores of the lake, and there speedily reared a shelter\\r\\nwhich, to them, presented all the comforts which the palatial mansion\\r\\noffers to its lord. They spread their mats upon the floor. They built\\r\\ntheir camp fires, whose brilliant blaze enlivened the scene. They\\r\\ncooked their suppers, of corn-bread and venison steaks, which health\\r\\nand hunger rendered luxurious. They sang songs, told stories, cracked\\r\\njokes, and enjoyed perhaps as much as the _mere animal man_ is capable\\r\\nof enjoying.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is indeed the sunny side of such a life. But it is a real side.\\r\\nFor such men it has a real charm; charms so great that they reluctantly\\r\\nrelinquish them for all that civilization can offer. But it must be\\r\\nevident to every reader of these pages, that this wandering, homeless\\r\\nlife, has also its shady side. They, like all other men, had often\\r\\noccasion to say in the beautiful verse of Longfellow:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"The day is cold, and dark, and dreary,\\r\\n    It rains, and the wind is never weary,\\r\\n    The vine still clings to the mouldering wall,\\r\\n    At every gust the dead leaves fall,\\r\\n    And the day is dark and dreary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle left Fort Frontenac on the 23d of July, 1680, about two months\\r\\nbefore the abandonment of CrÃ¨vecoeur by Tonti. In consequence of the\\r\\nseries of storms, he was nearly three weeks in reaching the western\\r\\nextremity of Lake Ontario. The canoes and the goods were then carried\\r\\naround the falls, to the station called Fort Conti, which had been\\r\\nestablished at the head of Niagara River. He did not reach this station\\r\\nuntil about the middle of August.\\r\\n\\r\\nFort Conti had become quite a resort of the neighboring Indian tribes\\r\\nfor trade. Here La Salle intended to lay in fresh supplies of corn. The\\r\\nseason had been an unfavorable one. The small crop annually raised by\\r\\nthe thoughtless, indolent savages, was still smaller than usual,\\r\\naffording but a scant supply for the winter. The Indians were not\\r\\ndisposed to sell. Many days passed away, and but little had been\\r\\nbrought in. La Salle had quite a store of French brandy. He offered to\\r\\nexchange brandy for corn. The poor Indians, who would sell the clothes\\r\\nfrom their backs for intoxicating liquors, brought the corn in so\\r\\nabundantly, that the canoes were immediately filled. In one day sixty\\r\\nsacks were urged upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 28th of August, 1680, the voyagers reÃ«mbarked in their canoes,\\r\\nand beneath sunny skies and with a smooth expanse of water before them,\\r\\npaddled joyously along the northern shores of Lake Erie, ascended the\\r\\nDetroit River, crossed Lake St. Clair, passed through the Straits of\\r\\nSt. Clair, and coasted along the eastern and northern shores of Lake\\r\\nHuron, a distance of two or three hundred miles, until they reached the\\r\\nstation at Mackinac, the latter part of September.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe voyage from the head of Niagara River had occupied nearly a month.\\r\\nWhen the little fleet of birch canoes entered the harbor at Mackinac,\\r\\nLieutenant Tonti had just abandoned his dilapidated birch canoe on the\\r\\nIllinois River, in his retirement from the fort, and, with his few\\r\\ncompanions, was struggling on foot through the wilderness west of Lake\\r\\nMichigan, seeking also the same refuge.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle, entirely unconscious of the disasters which had overtaken his\\r\\ngarrison at CrÃ¨vecoeur, reÃ«mbarked, on the 4th of October. Following\\r\\nthe same course he had pursued before, he paddled down the eastern\\r\\ncoast of Lake Michigan, to the River St. Joseph. At the head of which\\r\\nriver, it will be remembered, he had erected Fort Miami, on territory\\r\\ninhabited by the Miami Indians. It was a long voyage, with many\\r\\nobstructions from the autumnal storms, which seemed to be incessantly\\r\\nsweeping that bleak and harborless lake. After the tempestuous voyage\\r\\nof a month, he reached Fort Miami on the 3d of November.\\r\\n\\r\\nEleven months before, on the 3d of December, 1679, he had left that\\r\\nstation, on his route to the Illinois River. Le Clercq says that four\\r\\nmen were left in charge there. This is not sustained by other accounts.\\r\\nIt is not probable that so small a number would have been left in a\\r\\nposition so greatly exposed. But, however this may be, he found the\\r\\nMiami village in ashes, and all who dwelt in it dispersed. His log fort\\r\\nwas also in utter ruin. It was a melancholy scene which met his eye;\\r\\nanother indication of man\\'s inhumanity to man.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe St. Joseph\\'s River takes its rise in Indiana. For nearly a hundred\\r\\nmiles before it empties its flood into Lake Michigan, it flows in a\\r\\ncourse of narrow windings, almost directly from the south. By paddling\\r\\nup this stream, in a canoe voyage of three or four days, or about\\r\\nseventy miles of our measurement, they came to a portage, five or six\\r\\nmiles in length, by which they could reach the Kankakee River.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was an important tributary of the Illinois River. It will be\\r\\nremembered that it was by this stream that La Salle and his party, more\\r\\nthan a year before, prosecuted their voyage to Lake Peoria. It was\\r\\nthen, for much of its distance, rather a dismal stream, sluggishly\\r\\nwinding through marshes lined with alders. Rapidly they paddled on, day\\r\\nafter day, through a country of silence and solitude, until they\\r\\nentered the broader, deeper waters of Illinois River.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, as they descended this beautiful stream, which presented as\\r\\nattractive situations for happy homes as perhaps earth could afford,\\r\\nthey passed no Indian villages, no solitary wigwam, no sign whatever of\\r\\nhuman life. They came to the site where the Indian village had formerly\\r\\nstood in its picturesque beauty, with six or eight thousand inhabitants\\r\\nswarming around, in the various costumes, and engaged in the\\r\\ndiversified employments of savage life. Naught remained but smouldering\\r\\nruins and trampled harvests. Man bitterest foe, his brother man, had\\r\\nbeen there, and had left behind but the traces of desolation, blood and\\r\\nwoe. Neither wolf nor bear could have been more merciless, or could\\r\\nhave left behind them ravages so dreadful.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dispersion of the garrison, and the destruction of all the works\\r\\ncommenced and the stores deposited at CrÃ¨vecoeur, was another blow\\r\\nupon the head and the heart of La Salle, apparently frustrating all his\\r\\nplans. He must have experienced emotions of the keenest anguish. But\\r\\nthis remarkable man, invincible by the reverses of fortune, presented\\r\\nto his companions only a smiling aspect, and addressed them only with\\r\\ncheerful words. Having lost everything which he had expected to find at\\r\\nCrÃ¨vecoeur, it became necessary for him to return to Mackinac. This\\r\\nrequired a journey by river, forest, prairie, and lake, of nearly five\\r\\nhundred miles.\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately he reÃ«mbarked his whole force, in his canoes, and\\r\\ncommenced the laborious ascent of the stream he had just descended so\\r\\npleasantly, borne along by the aid of the current. When they reached\\r\\nthe mouth of the Kankakee, instead of following up that stream, they\\r\\nstruck across the country, by a portage directly north, until they\\r\\nreached the Chicago River. Here they again launched their canoes and\\r\\nfollowed down the windings of the stream until they came to its\\r\\nentrance into Lake Michigan, where Chicago now stands.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this port La Salle found fragments of many war-scathed tribes, in a\\r\\nhalf-starving condition. They informed him that the terrible Iroquois;\\r\\ncomposed of five united savage nations, and whose central power was in\\r\\nthe vast territory south of Lake Ontario, had in overwhelming numbers\\r\\ninvaded the valley of the Illinois. Many of their warriors were armed\\r\\nwith guns purchased from the French. The feeble tribes fled in terror\\r\\nbefore them. The ferocious bands wandered in all directions. By day and\\r\\nby night the hideous war-whoop resounded. Villages were burned,\\r\\ncaptives were seized, women and children were slaughtered, and\\r\\nthousands of fugitives, war-bereaved, woe-stricken, fled to the western\\r\\nside of the Mississippi to seek protection by being incorporated into\\r\\nfriendly tribes in those apparently limitless realms.\\r\\n\\r\\nAround the lovely shores of Lake Peoria there had been seventeen\\r\\nflourishing Indian villages. These were all destroyed, in awful scenes\\r\\nof conflagration and massacre. The survivors fled beyond the\\r\\nMississippi, six hundred miles from their desolated homes. And even to\\r\\nthese regions the ferocious Iroquois pursued them, thirsting for blood\\r\\nand scalps.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle was a Christian. He was interested in the religious welfare of\\r\\nthe poor Indians, as the only instrumentality by which they could\\r\\nsecure for themselves pleasant homes on earth, and happy homes in\\r\\nheaven. He agreed with the missionaries, that if they wished to\\r\\nestablish missions in those parts, with any hope of seeing Christianity\\r\\nmake progress among the natives, they must secure them immunity from\\r\\nthe horrors of war. This could only be done by uniting the remaining\\r\\ntribes in a firm union for a common defence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the mouth of the Chicago River, La Salle was, as he thought, by the\\r\\nroute he had taken, about one hundred and twenty miles from Lake\\r\\nPeoria. He reached this point probably some time in January 1681. The\\r\\nlake, for some distance from the shore, was encumbered with ice. Fierce\\r\\nwintry storms swept the bleak prairies, and piled the snow in drifts.\\r\\nIt was almost impossible to journey, either by land or water. La Salle\\r\\nand his party went into encampment upon the banks of the Chicago River,\\r\\nto wait a few weeks until the severity of winter was over. At the same\\r\\ntime, though he knew not of it, the few remaining members of the\\r\\ngarrison which he had left at CrÃ¨vecoeur were seeking shelter from\\r\\nthese piercing blasts, about a hundred miles north, in the wigwams of\\r\\nthe friendly Pottawattomies.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle and his ecclesiastical companions improved these few weeks of\\r\\nleisure in seeking interviews with the chiefs of the various tribes in\\r\\nthe vicinity, and in endeavoring to unite them in a strong confederacy.\\r\\nHe assured them that if they would thus be true to themselves, the\\r\\nFrench would become their allies and send them efficient aid. It was\\r\\nnot until the 22d of May that he was able to launch his canoes upon the\\r\\nlake. There was then a voyage of about two hundred and sixty miles\\r\\nbefore him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout the middle of June his fleet of canoes was seen, coming around a\\r\\npoint of land, as the boatmen rapidly paddled into the harbor at\\r\\nMichilimackinac. Here La Salle met Lieutenant Tonti, Father MembrÃ©, and\\r\\ntheir associates, as we have mentioned in the last chapter. The good\\r\\nFather MembrÃ© writes:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"I leave you to conceive our mutual joy, damped though it was by\\r\\n    the narrative he made us of all his misfortunes, and of that we\\r\\n    made him of our tragical adventures. Though La Salle related to us\\r\\n    all his calamities, yet never did I remark in him the least\\r\\n    alteration. He always maintained his ordinary coolness and\\r\\n    self-possession. Any other person would have abandoned the\\r\\n    enterprise. But La Salle, by a firmness of mind and constancy\\r\\n    almost unequalled, was more resolute than ever to carry out his\\r\\n    discovery. We therefore left, to return to Fort Frontenac with his\\r\\n    whole party, to adopt new measures, to resume and complete our\\r\\n    course, with the help of heaven, in which we put all our trust.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have no detailed account of the long voyage back to Frontenac, or of\\r\\nthe return voyage to the mouth of the Chicago River. In the meagre\\r\\nnarratives which have descended to us, there are slight discrepancies\\r\\nwhich it is impossible to reconcile. Entering Lake Michigan at its\\r\\nnorthern extremity through the Straits of Mackinac, they paddled down\\r\\nthe eastern coast, passed the mouth of St. Joseph\\'s River, rounded the\\r\\nsouthern curvature of the lake, and reached the mouth of the Chicago\\r\\nRiver on the 4th of January, 1682. The winter in that region was short,\\r\\nbut very severe. The Chicago River presented a solid surface of ice.\\r\\n\\r\\nSledges were constructed, upon which the canoes were placed, and\\r\\ndragged by the men over the ice of the river. This journey in\\r\\nmid-winter, over a bleak and often treeless expanse, was slow and\\r\\ntoilsome. Having reached the point where the portage commenced, they\\r\\ndragged their sledges, laden with the canoes, baggage, and provisions,\\r\\nacross the portage to the Illinois River. They reached this point on\\r\\nthe 29th of the month, having spent twenty-three days in the exhausting\\r\\njourney. They were, at that point, according to Father MembrÃ©\\'s\\r\\nestimate, two hundred and forty miles from the mouth of the Illinois\\r\\nwhere it enters into the Mississippi.\\r\\n\\r\\nDrawing their sledges upon the ice, they day after day followed down\\r\\nthe lonely and silent stream, whose banks war had desolated. They\\r\\npassed the smouldering sites of many former villages, where only\\r\\nmelancholy scenes of devastation met the eye. They reached CrÃ¨vecoeur\\r\\nabout the 1st of February. It would seem that La Salle, on his previous\\r\\nvisit, had repaired the ruins there, so as to provide a temporary home\\r\\nfor his party upon its arrival. He found all things as he had left\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe river below CrÃ¨vecoeur was free from ice. Having rested for about\\r\\na week, in the enjoyment of warm fires, in their log-cabins, they\\r\\nlaunched their canoes into the Illinois River, and on the 6th of\\r\\nFebruary reached the mouth of the river. They found the swollen flood\\r\\nof the Mississippi full of vast masses of ice, pouring down from the\\r\\ndistant regions of the north. This detained them till the 13th of the\\r\\nmonth. They encamped at the same point where Father Hennepin had\\r\\ntarried. A short voyage of a day bore them to the mouth of turbid and\\r\\nturbulent Missouri.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere they landed at an Indian village, where they seem to have been\\r\\nvery kindly received. It will be remembered that La Salle was still\\r\\nintent upon finding some short passage across the continent, of whose\\r\\nwidth he knew nothing, to the Pacific Ocean. He was much excited by the\\r\\nstrange tidings he heard from the Indians here. They assured him that\\r\\nby ascending the river ten or twelve days he would come to a range of\\r\\nmountains where the river took its rise; that numerous and populous\\r\\nIndian villages were scattered all the way along the banks of the\\r\\nriver; that by ascending one of the mountain eminences, he would have a\\r\\nview of the vast and boundless sea where great ships were sailing. We\\r\\ncannot now tell whether this was the mere fabrication of some\\r\\nimaginative savage, or whether such was the general opinion of the\\r\\ntribe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day, after a sail of about thirty miles, they reached another\\r\\nIndian village on the bank of the river. Here again they landed\\r\\npeacefully, and warmed the hearts of the savages by a few presents\\r\\nwhich were to them of priceless value. They journeyed slowly. They\\r\\ncould not, in their crowded canoes, carry a large amount of provisions.\\r\\nConsequently they were under the necessity of making frequent stops to\\r\\ncatch fish or to hunt for game. Not long after this visit of La Salle,\\r\\na mission was established in this little village, which was called\\r\\nMarou. It is said that most of them were converted to, at least,\\r\\nnominal Christianity.\\r\\n\\r\\nContinuing their voyage one hundred and twenty miles down the river,\\r\\nthey came to the mouth of the Ohio. Here they made another stop to lay\\r\\nin fresh supplies. The friendly Indians there informed them they could\\r\\nfind no suitable camping ground for a distance of nearly one hundred\\r\\nand fifty miles, the banks were so low and so encumbered with rushes\\r\\nand dense brush.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe voyagers remained at the mouth of the Ohio ten days, sending out\\r\\nparties in various directions. One of the Frenchmen, Peter Prudhomme,\\r\\nwandering from his companions, did not return. There were many fears\\r\\nthat he had been captured by the Indians, as some of the party had seen\\r\\nfresh Indian trails. The heroic La Salle was not disposed to abandon\\r\\nthe man. He threw up some entrenchments for the protection of his\\r\\ncompany, and despatched several well-armed Frenchmen, with Indian\\r\\nguides, to follow vigorously the trail of the savages, for the recovery\\r\\nof the captive if he had been taken by them. For four days La Salle\\r\\ntarried in his encampment at the mouth of the Ohio.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 1st of March the detachment, sent in pursuit of the lost one,\\r\\nreturned. They had seen and heard nothing of Peter. Five Indians,\\r\\nhowever, had been seen, two of whom were caught and brought into the\\r\\ncamp. They knew nothing of the lost man. Receiving only friendly\\r\\ntreatment, they seemed quite anxious that La Salle should visit their\\r\\nvillage, which they falsely assured La Salle was distant but a day and\\r\\na half\\'s journey from the point where they then were. These Indians\\r\\nbelonged to the Chickasaw tribe, which subsequently became quite\\r\\nprominent in the history of our land.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the Indians a day\\'s journey was about thirty miles. La Salle and\\r\\nFather MembrÃ© set out to visit the village, guided by the Indians. They\\r\\ndo not appear to have had any hesitation in thus placing themselves\\r\\nentirely in the hands of the savages. But after having travelled day\\r\\nand a half through a country diversified with forest, prairie, and\\r\\nmountain, they became satisfied that the Indians were deceiving them,\\r\\nand charged them with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey confessed the deception, made some lame apologies for it, and\\r\\nconfessed that their village was still at the distance of three days\\'\\r\\njourney. Without any apparent reluctance they accompanied La Salle and\\r\\nMembrÃ© back to the camp. La Salle then sent one of the Indians to the\\r\\nChickasaw village, with several presents, and to invite the chiefs to\\r\\nmeet him, some hundred miles below, as he descended in his canoes. The\\r\\nother Indian consented to remain, and accompany his party down the\\r\\nriver.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as the voyagers were reÃ«mbarking, the missing man appeared. He\\r\\nhad been lost in the forest and for nine days had wandered in the\\r\\nunavailing search for his companions. Fortunately, the weather was\\r\\nmild, game abundant, and, as he had his gun with him, he did not want\\r\\nfor food. Cheered by his return, they rejoicingly entered their canoes,\\r\\nand, with cloudless skies overarching them, pushed out into the rapid\\r\\ncurrent, to be swept along through realms to them entirely unknown, and\\r\\nto a point they knew not where.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a singular and a beautiful spectacle, which was presented by\\r\\nthis _flock_ of large birch canoes, eight or ten in number, filled\\r\\nwith Indians, and Frenchmen in Indian costume, gliding down the broad,\\r\\nswift current of the river. The paddles glistened with the reflected\\r\\nrays of the sun. All were in health. There was no toil. New scenes of\\r\\nmarvellous desolation, or beauty, or grandeur, were continually opening\\r\\nbefore them. They were well fed. The mind was kept in a state of\\r\\ndelightful excitement. The French are proverbially good-natured and\\r\\nmirthful. Each night\\'s encampment presented a scene of feasting,\\r\\nbonfires and innocent joyous revel. These were indeed sunny days, and\\r\\nthis was the poetry of travelling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 3d of March, 1682, came. They had then descended the river, as they\\r\\njudged, about one hundred and twenty miles below the mouth of the Ohio.\\r\\nThey were approaching, though they knew it not, a large village of the\\r\\nArkansas Indians, situated on the western banks of the Mississippi. It\\r\\nwas concealed from them by a bluff, and by a turn in the stream. An\\r\\nIndian, upon the lookout on the bluff, caught sight of the formidable\\r\\nlooking fleet, far up the river, and, supposing it to be filled with\\r\\nhostile savages on the war-path, gave the alarm.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole village was instantly thrown into a state of great\\r\\nexcitement. The women and children fled back into the forest. The\\r\\nwarriors grasped their arms and rallied for battle. As the fleet drew\\r\\nnear, all unconscious of the commotion it had excited, the voyagers,\\r\\nnot seeing a single Indian, were surprised to hear, on the other side\\r\\nof the bluff, the yells of apparently hundreds of savages. Their\\r\\npiercing war-whoops were blended with the loud beatings of a kind of\\r\\ndrum which they had fabricated.\\r\\n\\r\\nWarned by these hostile demonstrations, La Salle guided his canoes to\\r\\nthe other side of the river, which was here about a mile in width. He\\r\\nlanded in direct view of the village. With his customary caution, he\\r\\nimmediately threw up some intrenchments, behind which his men, with\\r\\ntheir guns, could beat off almost any number of savages. He knew not\\r\\nbut that hundreds of warriors would cross the river in their canoes, to\\r\\nmake an impetuous assault upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving thus guarded against surprise, and afforded the Indians a little\\r\\ntime to recover from their first alarm, he then, unarmed, advanced to\\r\\nthe water\\'s edge, and by friendly signs endeavored to invite some of\\r\\nthe chiefs to come over to meet him.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral of the chiefs entered a large boat, called a periagua. It was\\r\\nmade of the trunk of an immense tree, hollowed out, and carved and\\r\\ndecorated with immense labor. Such a wooden canoe was capable of\\r\\nholding a large number of warriors. The chiefs crossed the river until\\r\\nthey came to within a quarter of a mile of the shore, and then they\\r\\nstopped, and beckoned the strangers to come and meet them.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle sent one Frenchman, we infer from the narrative that it must\\r\\nhave been Father MembrÃ©, in a canoe, to meet them. Two of his Indians\\r\\npaddled the boat, until they came alongside of the periagua of the\\r\\nnatives. Father MembrÃ©, familiar as he was with several Indian\\r\\ndialects, could not speak their language. He however held out to them\\r\\nthe calumet of peace, which at once won their confidence; and he found\\r\\nno difficulty in communicating with them by signs. He invited the\\r\\nchiefs to accompany him back to the encampment. They were six in\\r\\nnumber. Retaining him with them, in the large periagua, they speedily\\r\\npaddled ashore, followed by MembrÃ©\\'s canoe, with the two Indian\\r\\nboatmen.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout any hesitancy, the six Indian chiefs entered into the redoubt\\r\\nwhich La Salle had thrown up. They appeared frank, unsuspicious, and\\r\\ncordial, and were made very happy by several presents which La Salle\\r\\nplaced in their hands. They invited the whole party to cross the river\\r\\nto their village. The canoes were launched, and all crossed the stream,\\r\\nled by the chieftains in their wooden boat. The whole adult male\\r\\npopulation of the village crowded the banks to receive them; and with\\r\\nevery demonstration of friendship. But the timid women and children\\r\\nkept cautiously in the distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nEight or ten large birch canoes, from which more than fifty persons\\r\\nlanded upon the beach, presented a very imposing appearance. They were\\r\\nnearly all armed with guns, not for aggressive warfare, but for hunting\\r\\nand protection.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe natives crowded around the strangers, conducted them up to their\\r\\nwigwams, which were very pleasantly situated on a rich and tolerably\\r\\nwell cultivated plain extending back from the river. The guests were\\r\\nregaled with the greatest profusion of barbarian hospitality. These\\r\\nIndians had attained a very considerable degree of civilization. They\\r\\nhad quite a large number of slaves, whom they had captured from tribes\\r\\nwith whom they were at war. The fertile fields around were quite well\\r\\ncultivated with corn, beans, melons, and a variety of fruits. Peaches\\r\\nwere abundant. Large flocks of turkeys and other domestic fowls crowded\\r\\ntheir doors. They were a very handsome race; and it was observed that,\\r\\nwhile the northern Indians were generally moody and taciturn, these\\r\\nsavages, beneath more sunny skies, were frank, generous, and gay in the\\r\\nextreme.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XI.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The Great Enterprise Accomplished._\\r\\n\\r\\nScenes in the Arkansas Villages. Indian Hospitality. Barbarian\\r\\nSplendor. Attractive Scenery. The Alarm. Its Joyful Issue. Genial\\r\\nCharacter of La Salle. Erecting the Cross. Pleasant Visit to the\\r\\nKoroas. The Two Channels. Perilous Attack. Humanity of La Salle. The\\r\\nSea Reached. Ceremonies of Annexation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor several days La Salle and his party remained with their hospitable\\r\\nfriends the Arkansas Indians. On the 14th of March, 1682, La Salle took\\r\\npossession of the country in the name of the king of France. He\\r\\ninvested the ceremony with all the pomp he could command. An immense\\r\\ncross was raised in the centre of the village; and the Christian\\'s God\\r\\nwas recognized with anthems, prayers and imposing religious rites.\\r\\nThousands of savages gathered around, gazing with delight upon the\\r\\nscene so novel to them. They had no conception of its significance.\\r\\nThey supposed it a festival got up for their entertainment, as they\\r\\nwould got up a war-dance to please their guests. As the cross was\\r\\nraised, Father MembrÃ© made some attempt to teach them the significance\\r\\nof this emblem of the way of salvation through faith in an atoning\\r\\nSaviour. He writes:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"During this time they showed that they relished what I said by\\r\\n    raising their eyes to heaven, and kneeling as if to adore. We also\\r\\n    saw them rubbing their hands over their bodies, after rubbing them\\r\\n    over the cross. In fine, on our return from the sea, we found that\\r\\n    they had surrounded the cross with a palisade.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 17th of the month, the explorers reÃ«mbarked, and continued\\r\\ntheir voyage down the river about eighteen miles, when they came to two\\r\\nother villages of the Arkansas tribe. Here they were again received\\r\\nwith the utmost hospitality. Continuing their sunny voyage beneath\\r\\ncloudless skies and upon a glassy stream for four days, they came to\\r\\nquite a large lake formed by an expansion of the river. This sheet of\\r\\nwater seemed to be fringed with villages. There were forty on the east\\r\\nside of the lake, and thirty-four on the west side, upon its banks. All\\r\\nwere picturesquely situated and, in the distance, presented an aspect\\r\\nof much beauty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe houses were well built, of clay mixed with straw baked in the sun.\\r\\nThe roofs were constructed of canes quite gracefully bent in the form\\r\\nof a dome. Their beds or mats were raised on wooden bedsteads, and they\\r\\nhad many convenient articles of household furniture. The bark of a tree\\r\\nfurnished very fine white fibres, which they braided into blankets and\\r\\nother articles of dress. The head chief was an absolute sovereign,\\r\\nhaving the property and the lives of his subjects entirely at his\\r\\ndisposal. A retinue of slaves attended him. He was luxuriously clothed,\\r\\nfed, and housed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe village of the chief was at a little distance from the banks of the\\r\\nlake. La Salle was quite sick, and unable to go up to the palace to pay\\r\\nhis respects to the monarch. He encamped upon the borders of the\\r\\nexpanded stream, and beneath the shade of his roof sought repose upon\\r\\nhis mat. He, however, sent Lieutenant Tonti and Father MembrÃ© with\\r\\npresents to the chief. In return, several men were sent to La Salle,\\r\\nmunificently laden with provisions and other gifts. Soon after, the\\r\\nking himself appeared in regal state. First came a master of\\r\\nceremonies, with six pioneers, to remove every obstruction from the\\r\\nway, and to make the path level for the feet of royalty. They selected\\r\\na spot upon which the monarch was to give audience to his guests. The\\r\\nground was carefully smoothed, and carpeted with beautiful mats.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe monarch soon made his appearance. He was richly dressed in white\\r\\nrobes. Two officers preceded him, bearing plumes of gorgeously colored\\r\\nfeathers. He was followed by another official, bearing two large plates\\r\\nof copper, highly polished. The king had the bearing of a gentleman. He\\r\\nwas grave, dignified, and courteous. Having ever been accustomed to\\r\\nabsolute command, he had that peculiar air of self-possession and\\r\\nauthority which seems to be the inheritance of those who can boast a\\r\\nlong line of illustrious ancestry.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the 22d day of March, 1682. The scene presented was in the\\r\\nhighest degree picturesque and beautiful. The widely expanded lake\\r\\nglittered in the sunlight as placid as a mirror. The villages of the\\r\\nIndians, clustered so thickly along the shores, were composed of\\r\\nsubstantial dwellings, whose roofs of curved canes, thatched with thick\\r\\nmats, were rounded into graceful domes. The barbarian splendor assumed\\r\\nby the monarch, the group of French adventurers, with their Indian\\r\\ncompanions, gathered near by, the thousands of the Taensa tribe, men,\\r\\nwomen, and children, standing at a respectful distance, silently gazing\\r\\nupon the scene, the little fleet of canoes upon the beach, and the\\r\\nencampment hastily thrown up--these combined to open to the eye a\\r\\npicture of peace and loveliness, which the pencil of the most skilful\\r\\nartist might in vain attempt to rival.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt did indeed seem then and there, as though God had intended this for\\r\\na happy world--for a world where his children might live together in\\r\\npaternal love, and with the interchange of the kindliest sympathies.\\r\\nThough in the early spring, the foliage beneath those sunny skies was\\r\\nin full leaf, and the flowers in full bloom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The whole country,\" writes Father MembrÃ©, \"is covered with palm trees,\\r\\nlaurels of two kinds, plums, peaches, mulberry, apple, and pear trees\\r\\nof every variety. There are also five or six kinds of nut trees, some\\r\\nof which bear nuts of extraordinary size. They also gave us several\\r\\nkinds of dried fruit to taste. We found them large and good. They have\\r\\nalso many varieties of fruit trees which I never saw in Europe. The\\r\\nseason was however too early to allow us to see the fruit. We observed\\r\\nvines already out of blossom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe interview between the monarch and La Salle passed off very\\r\\npleasantly. It was conducted mainly by signs. Smiles and presents were\\r\\ninterchanged. For four days the voyagers remained the guests of these\\r\\nfriendly people. They rambled through their villages, entered their\\r\\ndwellings, and were abundantly feasted. The natives seemed very\\r\\namiable, quite intelligent, and were far in advance, in civilization,\\r\\nof the nations or tribes farther north. Father MembrÃ© was much pleased\\r\\nwith their candor, and with the clearness with which he thought they\\r\\ncomprehended his instructions. They readily accepted his teaching of\\r\\nGod; and apparently comprehended, without any difficulty, the plan of\\r\\nsalvation through an atoning Saviour.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn truth, this doctrine is apparently the most simple and the most\\r\\npowerful which can be presented to the savage. All over the world, the\\r\\nnecessity of an atonement for sin seems to be implanted in the human\\r\\nbreast. And when the missionary teaches the savage that God, our\\r\\nHeavenly Father, in the person of His Son has borne our sins in His own\\r\\nbody on the tree, the most ignorant can comprehend it, and the most\\r\\nwicked can be moved by it.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 26th of March, La Salle and his companions, greatly refreshed by\\r\\ntheir delightful visit, resumed their voyage down the river. They\\r\\ndescended very rapidly, by the aid of the current and the paddle.\\r\\nHaving sailed about forty miles, they saw in the distance below them, a\\r\\nlarge wooden boat containing a number of Indians. The savages seemed\\r\\nalarmed as they caught sight of the fleet of canoes coming down so\\r\\nrapidly upon them. They plied their paddles with all diligence, and run\\r\\ninto the eastern shore.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle, with his usual caution, landed upon the opposite bank. The\\r\\ntwo parties gazed at each other across the rolling flood, a mile in\\r\\nwidth. La Salle sent Lieutenant Tonti, in a canoe with several Indians,\\r\\nto carry to the boatmen the calumet of peace. While the Indians plied\\r\\ntheir paddles, he stood up in the canoe, waving toward the boatmen the\\r\\nplumed badge of fraternity. As Lieutenant Tonti was crossing the river,\\r\\na large number of Indians were seen running in, from various\\r\\ndirections, and crowding the banks. When within arrow-shot of the\\r\\nshore, he stopped, still presenting the calumet, which all the tribes\\r\\nseemed to recognize and respect.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll suspicion was allayed. The savages, unapprehensive of any\\r\\ntreachery, crowded their periagua, and the boat and the canoe, with the\\r\\ninmates on terms of the kindest fellowship, passed over to the French\\r\\non the western bank. The two parties blended as brothers. The Indians\\r\\nwere fishermen of the Natches tribe. They had a large village about\\r\\nnine miles inland, east of the river. Without any hesitancy La Salle,\\r\\nFather MembrÃ©, and a few others, accepted an invitation to accompany\\r\\nthem to their village.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some men so frank, genial, kind-hearted that they win\\r\\naffection at sight. La Salle was such a man. With no special effort to\\r\\nmake friends, his nature was such that the savage and the civilized man\\r\\nalike were immediately won by the fascination of his presence. Father\\r\\nMembrÃ© gives frequent testimony to these peculiar attractions of the\\r\\nchivalric pioneer. On this occasion he writes:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"We slept in the wigwams of these savages. They gave us as kindly a\\r\\n    welcome as we could desire. The Chevalier La Salle, whose very air,\\r\\n    engaging manners, and captivating mind, everywhere commanded\\r\\n    respect and love, so impressed the hearts of these Indians that\\r\\n    they did not know how to treat us well enough. They would gladly\\r\\n    have kept us with them permanently.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor three days La Salle and his companions enjoyed the hospitality of\\r\\nthese friendly natives. About thirty miles below the Natches Indians,\\r\\nthere was another powerful tribe called the Koroas. They were friends\\r\\nand allies of the Natches. A courier was despatched to inform the chief\\r\\nof the Koroas of the arrival of the distinguished strangers, and to\\r\\ninvite him to come and share in giving them a suitable welcome. He\\r\\nhastened to Natches with an imposing retinue of his head men. They also\\r\\npaid prompt homage to the dignity and the attractions of La Salle.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain a cross was erected, while admiring multitudes gazed admiringly\\r\\nupon the religious and civil pomp with which the ceremony was invested.\\r\\nA plate was attached to the cross, upon which was engraved the arms of\\r\\nLouis XIV. The Indians were delighted with the show, and with the\\r\\nmemorial thus left of the visit; though they could not comprehend the\\r\\nsignificance of the rite as taking possession of their country in the\\r\\nname of the King of France.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle and his companions returned to their canoes. The Chickasaw\\r\\nIndian who had accompanied them from their encampment near the mouth of\\r\\nthe Ohio, and which they had named Camp Prudhomme, from the man who had\\r\\nbeen lost and found there, remained at the village of the Natches\\r\\nIndians. The journey of a few days would take him to his own tribe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chief of the Koroas, having invited La Salle to visit his village,\\r\\nembarked with his suite, in their wooden boats, and descended the river\\r\\nin company with the French in their birch canoes. A sail of about four\\r\\nhours swept them down to the village, which was called Akoroa. It was\\r\\nbeautifully situated on an eminence, commanding a view of a wide-spread\\r\\nand exceedingly fertile prairie, with large fields of corn, whose\\r\\nspear-like leaves were already waving in the gentle breeze.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indians were fond of ceremony. They held a council, presented the\\r\\ncalumet, smoked the pipe of fraternity, made speeches which were but\\r\\npoorly understood, and exchanged presents. After a short tarry, the\\r\\nvoyage was again resumed. The chief furnished them with a pilot,\\r\\ntelling them that it would still require a voyage of ten days to reach\\r\\nthe sea, and that the river broke into several channels or independent\\r\\nstreams as it approached the Gulf. As the Indians considered thirty or\\r\\nforty miles a good day\\'s voyage in descending the river, it was\\r\\nestimated that there was a journey of between three and four hundred\\r\\nmiles still before them. They were also informed that there were\\r\\nnumerous tribes upon the lower river, but that they were generally\\r\\nwell-disposed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 2d of April, when the canoes had descended the river about\\r\\neighteen miles below Akoroa, the river branched into two arms or\\r\\nchannels, with an island between, which they estimated to be one\\r\\nhundred and eighty miles in length. They had been directed to take the\\r\\nchannel on the left. But it so chanced that there was a heavy river\\r\\nfog, and they did not see it. La Salle\\'s canoe was in the advance, and\\r\\nthe canoe which held the guide happened to be far in the rear. Though\\r\\nthe keen eyes of the Indian pierced the fog, and he did all in his\\r\\npower by signs to show them that they were wrong, the whole fleet\\r\\nfollowed its leader, and were swept along in the channel on the right.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason why they were cautioned to take the left branch, was that\\r\\nthe eight or ten tribes on the western banks were friendly, and would\\r\\nmake them no trouble, while those upon the eastern branch were\\r\\nferocious, and would be likely to attack them. They soon experienced\\r\\nthe wisdom of the advice which had been given them.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 2d of April, when they had descended the river about one hundred\\r\\nand twenty miles, they saw a number of Indians on the bank of the\\r\\nriver, fishing. The moment the savages caught sight of the fleet of\\r\\ncanoes they fled. Immediately the forest seemed filled with the clamor\\r\\nof hideous war-whoops the beating of drums, and all other sounds of\\r\\nhostility. The branch of the river which they were descending, was here\\r\\ncompressed into a narrow channel. A dense forest fringed both banks. It\\r\\nwas evident that there were populous villages near by, for the warriors\\r\\nwere seen rapidly gathering, as they ran from tree to tree to get good\\r\\npositions to overwhelm the canoes with their arrows.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bows were very strong. The muscular arms of the Indians would throw\\r\\nan arrow with almost the velocity and precision of a rifle bullet.\\r\\nThese barbed weapons would tear their way through the birch bark of the\\r\\ncanoes as if they were but sheets of brown paper. With appalling\\r\\nsuddenness this cloud of war was marshalling its forces. It was\\r\\nsufficiently menacing to alarm the bravest heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle ordered all the boats to stop. He then sent one canoe forward,\\r\\nwith four Frenchmen, to present the calumet of peace. They received\\r\\norders not to fire upon the savages under any emergence. As soon as the\\r\\ncanoe came within arrow-shot, the savages, regardless of the calumet,\\r\\nlet fly a shower of arrows upon them. Fortunately, they nearly all fell\\r\\na little short, and no one was hit. With the utmost precipitation, the\\r\\nFrenchmen paddled back to their companions. La Salle then sent another\\r\\ncanoe, with four Indians, bearing the calumet. They advanced with great\\r\\ncaution, and met with the same hostile reception.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then directed the canoes to press as near the opposite bank as\\r\\npossible, to ply their paddles with all energy, and thus hurry by the\\r\\npoint of peril. Humanely he ordered not a gun to be fired. He had no\\r\\nwish to engage in a battle in which nothing was to be gained. Very\\r\\neasily his sharp-shooters could cause many of those savage warriors to\\r\\nbite the dust, and thus lamentation and woe would be sent to many of\\r\\nthose wigwams. But this would do no good. It would not subdue the\\r\\nsavages; it would only exasperate them. He also remembered that he was\\r\\nto return, and that if the savages had received no harm at his hands,\\r\\ntheir spirit of revenge would not be aroused, and it would be much less\\r\\ndifficult to establish friendly relations with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the savages yelled, and ran franticly along the shore, and threw\\r\\ntheir arrows with their utmost strength, the canoes, swept along by the\\r\\nrapid current, and the sinewy strength of the paddles, all passed in\\r\\nsafety. The kind-hearted La Salle must have congratulated himself that\\r\\nnone were left behind to mourn. He afterwards learned that this\\r\\ninhospitable tribe was called the Quinnipissa.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had paddled down the stream but about six miles, when they came to\\r\\nother and still more deplorable evidences of man\\'s inhumanity to man.\\r\\nThey found upon the banks the smouldering remains of a large village,\\r\\nwhich had recently been sacked and burned. It was evident that the\\r\\ninhabitants had been given up to indiscriminate massacre, with the\\r\\nexception of those who had been carried away into slavery, or to add to\\r\\nthe revelry of a gala day, in the endurance of demoniac torture. The\\r\\nground was covered with the bodies of men, women, and children, in all\\r\\nthe loathsome stages of decay. Sadly the voyagers rambled through these\\r\\nawful scenes for an hour, meeting with no living being, and then\\r\\nhurried on their way. This village, it was subsequently ascertained,\\r\\nwas called Tangibao.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill they continued descending the river four days longer, without\\r\\nmeeting any incident of importance. Their day\\'s sail averaged about\\r\\nthirty miles. It was always necessary to land for the night\\'s\\r\\nencampment. They had made, as they estimated, about one hundred and\\r\\ntwenty miles from Quinnipissa when they came to the delta of the\\r\\nMississippi. Here the majestic river divided into four branches. At\\r\\nthis point they landed, and encamped in the midst of a dense and almost\\r\\ntropical forest, upon the bank, but slightly elevated above the surface\\r\\nof the water.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning La Salle divided his fleet into three bands, one to\\r\\ndescend each of these three branches. He took the one on the extreme\\r\\nright, or the western branch. Lieutenant Tonti, with Father MembrÃ©,\\r\\ntook the middle. The eastern branch, on the left, was assigned to Mr.\\r\\nDautray. Upon reaching the sea, the canoes on the right and left were\\r\\nto turn toward the centre until they should meet the party of\\r\\nLieutenant Tonti, whose route to the sea, it was supposed, would be a\\r\\nlittle shorter than that of either of the other two.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all found the water deep and brackish, and the current very slow.\\r\\nAfter sailing a few miles they tasted the salt of the ocean. Soon their\\r\\neyes were gladdened with the sight of the open sea. It was mild,\\r\\nserene, beautiful summer weather. The region, as far as the eye could\\r\\nreach, was low and marshy, with no landmarks. The fleets were, however,\\r\\nall reunited in safety. La Salle having heard the report respecting the\\r\\nmiddle and eastern channels, decided to return to the western, by which\\r\\nhe had descended.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey then ascended this branch before they could find any dry and solid\\r\\nground, suitable to afford a permanent foundation for the cross of\\r\\nChrist and the arms of France. On the ninth of April, they were all\\r\\nassembled on a ridge slightly elevated, for the celebration of this\\r\\nall-important ceremony. First, they raised a massive column, at the\\r\\nfoot of which they buried a leaden plate, bearing an inscription in\\r\\nLatin, to the following purport:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Louis the Great Reigns. Robert, Cavalier, with Lord Tonti,\\r\\n    Ambassador, Zenobia MembrÃ©, Ecclesiastic, and twenty Frenchmen,\\r\\n    first navigated this river from the country of the Illinois, and\\r\\n    passed through this mouth on the ninth of April, sixteen hundred\\r\\n    and eighty-two.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe names of all the Frenchmen of the party were attached to this\\r\\nplate. La Salle then made a speech, which was carefully worded, and\\r\\nseems to have been recorded at that time. It was in substance as\\r\\nfollows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the name of Louis the Great, and in virtue of the commission I hold\\r\\nin my hand, I take possession of this country of Louisiana, its seas,\\r\\nharbors, ports, bays, and adjacent straits; and also of all the\\r\\nnations, people, provinces, cities, towns, villages, mines, minerals,\\r\\nfisheries, streams, and rivers, comprised in the extent of the said\\r\\nLouisiana, from the mouth of the great river called the Ohio, and this\\r\\nwith the consent of the people dwelling therein, with whom we have made\\r\\nalliance; and also of the rivers which discharge themselves therein,\\r\\nfrom the sources of the Mississippi to its mouth in the sea; upon the\\r\\nassurance of all these nations that we are the first Europeans who have\\r\\ndescended or ascended the said Mississippi. I hereby protest against\\r\\nall those who may in future undertake to invade any of these countries,\\r\\nto the prejudice of the right of his Majesty, acquired by the consent\\r\\nof all the nations herein named. Of this I take to witness all those\\r\\nwho hear me, and demand an act of the Notary as required by law.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this the whole assembly responded with shouts of Vive le Roi and\\r\\nwith a salute of fire-arms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe civic ceremony being thus ended, the transaction was now to be\\r\\nratified with religious rites. By the side of the column, a massive\\r\\ncross had been erected. The devout La Salle, who was earnestly a\\r\\nreligious man, took his position at the foot of the cross, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His Majesty, Louis the Great, the eldest son of the Church, will annex\\r\\nno country to his crown without making it his chief care to establish\\r\\nthe Christian religion therein. Its symbol must now be recognized.\"\\r\\nSeveral Christian hymns were then chanted. The sublime strains of the\\r\\nTe Deum resounded through the arches of the forest; and other\\r\\nceremonies of the Catholic Church were performed with all the pomp\\r\\nwhich the circumstances would allow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus the great achievement was accomplished. According to the then\\r\\nexisting law of nations, the whole valley of the Mississippi was\\r\\nannexed to France. It was indeed a magnificent acquisition. It is\\r\\nestimated that the kingdom of France comprises an extent not quite\\r\\nthree hundred thousand square miles. It is judged that the valley of\\r\\nthe Mississippi drains a region of one million square miles. Thus the\\r\\npioneer, La Salle, conferred upon France a territory more than three\\r\\ntimes as large as the kingdom of France itself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XII.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The Return Voyage_.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Numerous Alligators.

His Arrival at Fort Miami.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no game to be taken in the vast swamps at the mouth of the\\r\\nriver. The provisions of the voyagers were nearly exhausted. They,\\r\\nhowever, chanced to find an abandoned Indian camp, where there was a\\r\\nsmall quantity of strips of the flesh of some animal, dried in the sun.\\r\\nAs they were eagerly eating it, the Indians who accompanied them\\r\\ninformed them that it was human flesh. It is needless to say that they\\r\\ncould eat no more; though the savages, who devoured it with much gusto,\\r\\ndeclared that it was exceedingly delicate and savory.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 10th of April, the next day after the ceremony of annexation,\\r\\nthey commenced their toilsome ascent of the river on their voyage back.\\r\\nEnormous alligators were often met with, sunning themselves on the\\r\\nsand-bars. The sharp-shooters soon learned where the bullet would\\r\\nstrike a vulnerable point. For several days they lived mainly on wild\\r\\npotatoes and the flesh of alligators. The country was so low, and so\\r\\nbordered with almost impenetrable canes, that they could not hunt\\r\\nwithout making long delays. At length they reached the blackened ruins\\r\\nand the mouldering dead of Tangibao. The desolation remained complete.\\r\\nNone had returned.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a matter of the utmost importance, apparently of absolute\\r\\nnecessity, that they should lay in a store of corn. There was so much\\r\\nuncertainty as to hunting, that they might be many days without food,\\r\\nand thus perish. But a pint of corn, pounded into meal and baked in the\\r\\nashes, would afford a hungry man a very nutritious dinner. And if so\\r\\nsuccessful as to take some game, this bread gave great additional zest\\r\\nto the repast.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the thirteenth day, as they were slowly paddling against the stream,\\r\\nthey saw, far away in the north, a great smoke, apparently from Indian\\r\\nfires. It was evidently not far from the region where the Quinnipissa\\r\\nIndians had so fiercely attacked them, but a few days before. Much\\r\\napprehension was felt lest they should again be assailed. The passage\\r\\nagainst the rapid current was necessarily very slow. The Indians had\\r\\nlarge wooden boats, which they could fill with warriors, and being\\r\\nabove them on the river, could completely cut off their retreat.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle sent one of the canoes forward to reconnoitre. As his Indian\\r\\nboatmen were paddling cautiously along beneath the dense foliage of the\\r\\nbanks, they caught sight of four women. Under the perilous\\r\\ncircumstances, it was thought best to capture them, if possible, and\\r\\nhold them as hostages for the good behavior of the tribe. This was not\\r\\ndoing evil that good might come, for the measure was fully justifiable,\\r\\nin view of the attack which had been made upon them, and as the only\\r\\nmeans of preventing the effusion of blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men landed, and the swift runners caught the women and took them\\r\\nback to the fleet. It was then learned that the Quinnipissa Indians, a\\r\\npeculiarly warlike and ferocious race, had a large village but a little\\r\\ndistance farther up the river. This village it was necessary to pass.\\r\\nThere could be no doubt that the savages would fiercely assail them. As\\r\\nthey could probably bring many hundred warriors into the conflict, and\\r\\ncould make the attack not only from their capacious periaguas, but also\\r\\nfrom the shelter of the trees on the bank, the situation of the French\\r\\nseemed quite desperate.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle, in this emergence, drew his canoes to the shore, a little\\r\\nbelow the village, and on the opposite bank. He hoped, by the aid of\\r\\nhis captives, to open some communication with the foe. But the Indians\\r\\nhad already learned of his approach. Again the hideous clamor of\\r\\ndemoniac war was heard, as the noise of their rude drums and savage\\r\\nyells fell upon the ear.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was early in the afternoon of a day of almost tropical warmth and\\r\\nserenity, when all the voices of nature seemed to invite man to love\\r\\nand help his brother. Soon quite a fleet of massive boats was seen,\\r\\ndescending the river, each boat crowded with twenty or thirty warriors,\\r\\nplumed and painted, and armed with bows and arrows, javelins, and\\r\\nclubs. They were yelling like demons, as if expecting by noise to rouse\\r\\ntheir courage to the highest point.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle himself, with two or three picked companions, pushed out in a\\r\\ncanoe, and advanced to meet them. Though one or two guns were in the\\r\\nbottom of the canoe, to be used in case of absolute necessity, they\\r\\nappeared entirely unarmed--a single canoe advancing to meet a fleet. La\\r\\nSalle stood up and waved the calumet, the sacred emblem of peace and\\r\\nfriendship. The savages, thirsty for blood, paid no heed to this\\r\\nappeal. They redoubled their yells, and like a band of desperate\\r\\nvillains as they were, shot a volley of arrows toward the one canoe\\r\\nwith its three or four unarmed occupants. With new vigor the savages\\r\\nplied their paddles, being now sure of the capture of the strangers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moment for prompt and decisive action had come. The guns were\\r\\nheavily loaded. One of the boats, larger and more richly ornamented\\r\\nthan the rest, contained evidently the head chief. He was a man of\\r\\nherculean frame, dressed in the most gorgeous of barbaric attire. As he\\r\\nstood up in his boat, giving orders, he presented just the target,\\r\\nthough at a great distance, to which a sharp-shooter might direct\\r\\nunerring aim. La Salle ordered one of his marksmen to strike him down.\\r\\nAfter a moment\\'s pause, there was a flash, a slight puff of smoke, a\\r\\nloud report, and the invisible bullet pierced the heart of the chief.\\r\\nThe blood gushed forth in a torrent, and the warrior dropped dead in\\r\\nthe bottom of the boat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe warriors were appalled, terrified. Never before had they heard the\\r\\nreport of a gun. They knew not what had struck down their chief. No\\r\\nmissile had been seen. None could be found. The savages were very\\r\\nsuperstitious. They thought this must be the work of witchcraft; that\\r\\nthey were attacked by evil spirits, whose power was invincible. They\\r\\nhad seen the lightning flash, and the rising, vanishing cloud. They had\\r\\nheard the thunder peal. Their chief had been struck dead by some\\r\\nresistless bolt, at twice the distance to which any arrow could be\\r\\nthrown. It was folly to contend against such a foe. The next instant\\r\\nevery one might be stricken down. They were seized with a panic.\\r\\nInstantly, heading the bows of their boats up the river, they fled with\\r\\nthe utmost precipitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle returned to his companions, conscious that he had secured a\\r\\ntruce only. He had still the village to pass; and the current was so\\r\\nstrong that he must pass very slowly. It was probable that the Indians\\r\\nwould so far recover from their consternation, that some of the boldest\\r\\nwould again assail his boats, from behind sheltering rocks and trees.\\r\\nThe frail canoes might easily be pierced by their missiles, and the\\r\\ninmates thrown into the water. The savages would soon become accustomed\\r\\nto the report of the guns. Finding that rocks and trees protected them\\r\\nfrom the invisible bolt, they would all be emboldened; and thus a\\r\\ngeneral and prolonged attack, following them up the river, would cause\\r\\ntheir entire destruction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe utmost wisdom was still requisite, to rescue the party from these\\r\\nperils. La Salle loaded one of the women with rich presents of axes,\\r\\nknives, and beads, and sent her across the river in one of his canoes.\\r\\nBy signs he told her to inform her tribe that he wished for friendship\\r\\nwith them; that if they would be friendly, and bring him in a supply of\\r\\ncorn, he would liberate his three other captives, and pay liberally for\\r\\nthe corn, in articles which would be of great value to the Indians.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning a large number of Indian warriors were seen\\r\\napproaching the encampment, where the Frenchmen had thrown up defences\\r\\nwhich would enable them to sell their lives dearly, were the savages\\r\\ndetermined upon their destruction. La Salle, as bold as he was humane,\\r\\nadvanced alone to meet them, presenting the calumet. The Indians\\r\\nassumed a friendly attitude, entered into a treaty of peace, and\\r\\ninvited La Salle, with his party, to visit their village. They also\\r\\nbrought him a considerable store of corn. Though their manner was such\\r\\nas to lead La Salle greatly to doubt their sincerity, he accepted their\\r\\ninvitation, first exacting hostages to remain in the camp until his\\r\\nreturn. He took with him Father MembrÃ©, his invariable companion on\\r\\nsuch occasions. The mild, fearless, heroic missionary writes:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"We went up to the village where these Indians had prepared us a\\r\\n    feast in their fashion. They had notified their allies and\\r\\n    neighbors; so that when we went to enjoy the banquet, in a large\\r\\n    square, we saw a confused mass of armed savages arrive, one after\\r\\n    another. We were however welcomed by the chiefs; but, having ground\\r\\n    for suspicion, each kept his gun ready, and the Indians, seeing it,\\r\\n    durst not attack us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nToward evening, La Salle and his companion returned to the camp, still\\r\\napprehensive that the Indians meditated treachery. They released the\\r\\nthree women, whom they made very happy, with rich presents. A careful\\r\\nwatch was kept through the night. Before the dawn of the next morning\\r\\nthe sentinels reported that they heard a noise, as if a multitude of\\r\\nmen were stealthily gathering in a dense growth of canes, but a short\\r\\ndistance from the encampment. All were instantly summoned to arms.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a gloomy morning, very dark, with moaning wind and gathering\\r\\nclouds and falling rain. The men had but just taken their stations,\\r\\nbehind the intrenchments which had been so prudently raised, when the\\r\\nshrill war-whoop burst from apparently hundreds of savage lips; and\\r\\nfrom the impenetrable darkness a shower of arrows came whizzing through\\r\\nthe air. They all fell harmless in and around the spot where the men\\r\\nstood, behind their ramparts, with muskets loaded and primed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the savages kept up an incessant yell, and threw their arrows\\r\\nalmost at random into the narrow enclosure, they were so concealed by\\r\\nthe darkness and the thick cane-brake, that not one was to be seen. The\\r\\nFrench kept perfect silence. Not a loud word was spoken. Not a musket\\r\\nwas fired. It was very important that every bullet should accomplish\\r\\nits mission and lay a warrior dead in his blood. The Indians were to be\\r\\ntaught that every flash and peal was the sure precursor of the death or\\r\\nthe serious wound of one of their number.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon the day began to dawn. With the increasing light the savages were\\r\\nrevealed, as they dodged from point to point. There was no random\\r\\nfiring of the guns. Deliberate aim was taken. The savages were very\\r\\ncautious in exposing themselves. The Frenchmen were perfectly protected\\r\\nfrom their arrows by the rampart of logs. For two hours this strange\\r\\nbattle raged--twenty Frenchmen against hundreds of savages. Ten Indians\\r\\nwere shot dead. Many others were dreadfully wounded with shattered\\r\\nbones. It is probable that every bullet hit its mark. Not an arrow of\\r\\nthe savage had drawn blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the sun rose, revealing the deadly fire of the guns and the utter\\r\\nimpotence of the missiles of the Indians, the savages were again thrown\\r\\ninto a panic, and fled precipitately. La Salle, with nearly all his\\r\\nforce, pursued them up to the village, where, with axes, he speedily\\r\\ndemolished all their boats, so that they could not pursue, as he should\\r\\ncontinue his voyage. His men urged him to burn the village of his\\r\\ntreacherous foes. But he refused, saying that he would inflict no\\r\\nfarther injury upon them than was absolutely necessary in self-defence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the close of this day of gloom, battle, and blood, another night\\r\\ncame, of darkness and rain. Enveloped in the shades of night, the\\r\\nFrench reÃ«mbarked. Silently they passed the village. Not a savage\\r\\n\"opened his mouth or peeped.\" The storm passed away. And when the sun\\r\\nof another lovely morning shone down upon them, the voyagers were far\\r\\nbeyond the reach of their cruel foes. Father MembrÃ© returned thanks to\\r\\nGod that He had borne them, unharmed, through such great peril, and had\\r\\nrestrained them from the exercise of any unchristian revenge. It was\\r\\nthe morning of the 19th of April.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor twelve days they continued breasting the current of the stream, as\\r\\nthey laboriously paddled their way upward. Anxious to return to Quebec\\r\\nas soon as possible, with the tidings of their glorious achievement,\\r\\nthey made no tarry at the many villages which were scattered along the\\r\\nbanks. They often saw assemblages of Indians, who seemed to assume a\\r\\nhostile attitude. No attack was, however, made upon them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn descending the river they had a good supply of corn, and stored away\\r\\nquite a quantity in a _cache_. They found it, on their return, in good\\r\\ncondition, and it furnished them with a very opportune supply. They\\r\\nwere surprised to see how rapidly the corn in the fields matured.\\r\\nFields were passed on the 29th of March, where the tender blades were\\r\\njust sprouting from the ground. And now, in less than four weeks, the\\r\\ncorn was fit to roast. They were told that, in fifty days from\\r\\nplanting, it often ripened.\\r\\n\\r\\nA short tarry was made at the friendly village of the Taensa Indians,\\r\\nwhere they were again very hospitably entertained. On the 1st of May\\r\\nthey resumed their slow and laborious voyage, and reached the Arkansas\\r\\nIndians about the 15th of the month. On the 16th La Salle took two\\r\\nlight canoes, propelled by sturdy Indian rowers, and pushed on in\\r\\nadvance of the rest of the party. He gave directions for the other\\r\\ncanoes to follow as fast as they could. But he was taken dangerously\\r\\nsick on the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nA birch canoe, in which one is exposed to the rays of the noonday sun,\\r\\nto the chill dews of morning and evening, to drenching showers and\\r\\ndreary days of clouds and rain, presents but few comforts to a man in\\r\\nsickness and suffering. He, however, succeeded, after a toilsome voyage\\r\\nof about ten days, in reaching his old encampment, which he had named\\r\\nPrudhomme, near the mouth of the Ohio River.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere his malady grew so alarming that he could go no farther. His party\\r\\nlanded, drew their canoes up upon the grass of the prairie, repaired\\r\\ntheir camp, so as to make it an effectual protection from sun and rain,\\r\\nspread mats upon the ground, and made the sick man, who they feared was\\r\\nsoon to die, as comfortable as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn such cases a camp was generally built in the form of a shed, with\\r\\nthe front entirely open. This camp was on the eastern side of the\\r\\nriver, facing the majestic stream and the splendors of the setting sun.\\r\\nLa Salle had no physician, no medicine, no tender nursing, no delicate\\r\\nfood to tempt a failing appetite. He could only lie patiently upon his\\r\\nmat, and await the progress of the disease, whether it were for life or\\r\\nfor death. The silence and solitude of the river, the prairie, and the\\r\\nforest surrounded him.\\r\\n\\r\\nStrange must have been his reflections in those solemn hours, when he\\r\\nwas anticipating the speedy approach of death, upon the banks of that\\r\\nwonderful stream which his enterprise had caused to be explored from\\r\\nits sources to its mouth. As in languor and suffering he reclined upon\\r\\nhis couch, all the beauty and bloom of May, in a delightful clime, were\\r\\nspread around him. The silent flood swept by, rushing down a distance\\r\\nof countless leagues in the north, until, after a serpentine course of\\r\\nmore than a thousand miles, through the most wonderful scenes of\\r\\nnature, and fringed with the villages of innumerable savage tribes, it\\r\\nwas lost in the great Mexican gulf. The Indians moved about in silence,\\r\\nseldom exchanging a word with each other. They brought in game, and\\r\\nwere continually cooking and eating at the fire, which was kept in a\\r\\nconstant blaze in front of the camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo days and nights were thus passed, when, on the 2d of June, the\\r\\nremaining canoes of the fleet were seen in the distance, approaching\\r\\nthe encampment. They soon landed; and the whole party, over fifty in\\r\\nnumber, presented to the eye a new scene of bustle and activity. La\\r\\nSalle was sinking, in the ever-increasing languor of something like\\r\\ntyphoid fever. It was manifest that many days must elapse before he\\r\\ncould leave that spot, and it was probable, in his own judgment as well\\r\\nas in that of all his companions, that he would there sink into that\\r\\nlast sleep from which there is no earthly waking.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn these trying hours, his serenity and trust in God did not forsake\\r\\nhim. He called Lieutenant Tonti to the side of his couch, and directed\\r\\nhim to take several canoes, with the larger part of the company, and\\r\\nmake his way, as vigorously as possible, up the river three hundred\\r\\nmiles to the mouth of the Illinois River. Then, ascending that, and its\\r\\nupper branch, the Kaskaskias, he was to cross by the portage to a\\r\\ntributary of the St. Joseph\\'s, and paddle down those streams to Fort\\r\\nMiami, where the St. Joseph empties into Lake Michigan. Thence by the\\r\\nlake he was to make his way to Mackinac. This required a journey of\\r\\nover a thousand miles. M. Tonti was furnished with documents addressed\\r\\nto Count Frontenac, Governor of Canada, giving a detailed account of\\r\\nthe explorations and discoveries which La Salle had so successfully\\r\\naccomplished. Father MembrÃ©, with several others of the party, remained\\r\\nwith the sick man.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor more than a month the burning fever raged, and La Salle was brought\\r\\nto the verge of the grave. The fever then left him. For some time it\\r\\nwas doubtful whether there was sufficient strength remaining for him to\\r\\nrecover. Slowly he gained. After a detention of forty days, they placed\\r\\nhim carefully upon mats, in the bottom of a canoe, and, by short\\r\\nstages, resumed their voyage. They left Fort Prudhomme, and, following\\r\\nthe same track which Tonti had pursued, did not reach Fort Miami, at\\r\\nthe mouth of the St. Joseph\\'s River, until the end of September. But\\r\\nJuly and August were months of delightful weather. The scenery, rich\\r\\nwith forest grandeur and prairie flowers, was varied and enchanting.\\r\\nGame was abundant. Ripe fruit hung on many boughs. Hospitable villages\\r\\nwere scattered along the way, where the general voyagers were\\r\\ninvariably received with kindness truly fraternal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe motion of the canoe, as the Indians, with brawny arms, paddled over\\r\\nthe mirrored surface of the stream, was soothing and grateful to the\\r\\nlanguid, yet convalescent patient. In the cool of the beautiful\\r\\nmornings they could glide along the stream for a few leagues, then\\r\\nshelter themselves in some shady grove from the rays of the noonday\\r\\nsun, and in the cool of the serene evenings, resume their voyage till\\r\\nthe deepening twilight admonished them to seek their night\\'s\\r\\nencampment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus pleasantly journeying, La Salle rapidly regained strength; and\\r\\nwhen he reached Fort Miami he was restored to almost his customary\\r\\nvigor. He found the habitation called Fort Miami quite renovated by\\r\\nLieutenant Tonti, and a few men left in garrison to receive him upon\\r\\nhis arrival. Quite a cluster of Indian wigwams had also been reared\\r\\nthere, giving a very animated and cheerful aspect to the spot. Father\\r\\nMembrÃ©, in describing the scenery through which they passed, in this\\r\\nascent of the Mississippi and the Illinois, writes:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"The banks of the Mississippi, for twenty or thirty leagues from\\r\\n    its mouth, are covered with a dense growth of canes, except in\\r\\n    fifteen or twenty places where there are very pretty hills and\\r\\n    spacious, convenient landing-places. Behind this fringe of marshy\\r\\n    land you see the finest country in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Our hunters, both French and Indian, were delighted with it. For\\r\\n    an extent of six hundred miles in length, and as much in breadth,\\r\\n    we were told there are vast fields of excellent land, diversified\\r\\n    with pleasing hills, lofty woods, groves through which you might\\r\\n    ride on horseback, so clear and unobstructed are the paths.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"These little forests also line the rivers which intersect the\\r\\n    country in various places, and which abound in fish. The crocodiles\\r\\n    are dangerous here; so much so, that, in some places, no one would\\r\\n    venture to expose himself, or even to put his hand out of his\\r\\n    canoe. The Indians told us that these animals often dragged in\\r\\n    their people, where they could anywhere get hold of them.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"The fields are full of all kinds of game, wild cattle, does, deer,\\r\\n    stags, bears, turkeys, partridges, parrots, quails, woodcock, wild\\r\\n    pigeons, and ringdoves. There are also beaver, otters, and martens.\\r\\n    The cattle of this country surpass ours in size. Their head is\\r\\n    monstrous, and their look is frightful, on account of the long,\\r\\n    black hair with which it is surrounded, and which hangs below the\\r\\n    chin. The hair is fine, and scarce inferior to wool. The Indians\\r\\n    wear their skins, which they dress very neatly. They assured us\\r\\n    that, inland, toward the west, there are animals on which men ride,\\r\\n    and which carry very heavy loads. They described them as horses,\\r\\n    and showed two feet, which were actually hoofs of horses.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"We observed wood fit for every use. There were the most beautiful\\r\\n    cedars in the world. There was one kind of tree which shed an\\r\\n    abundance of gum, as pleasant to burn as the best French pastilles.\\r\\n    We also saw fine hemlocks, and other large trees with white bark.\\r\\n    The cotton-wood trees were very large. Of these, the Indians dug\\r\\n    out canoes forty or fifty feet long. Sometimes there were fleets of\\r\\n    a hundred and fifty at their villages. We saw every kind of tree\\r\\n    fit for ship-building. There is also plenty of hemp for cordage,\\r\\n    and tar could be made in abundance.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Prairies are seen everywhere. Sometimes they are fifty or sixty\\r\\n    miles in length on the river front, and many leagues in depth. They\\r\\n    are very rich and fertile, without a stone or a tree to obstruct\\r\\n    the plough. These prairies are capable of sustaining an immense\\r\\n    population. Beans grow wild, and the stalks last several years,\\r\\n    bearing fruit. The bean vines are thicker than a man\\'s arm, and run\\r\\n    to the top of the highest trees. Peach trees are abundant, and bear\\r\\n    fruit equal to the best which can be found in France. They are\\r\\n    often so loaded, in the gardens of the Indians, that they have to\\r\\n    prop up the branches. There are whole forests of mulberries, whose\\r\\n    ripened fruit we began to eat in the month of May. Plums are found\\r\\n    in great variety, many of which are not known in Europe. Grapevines\\r\\n    and pomegranates are common. Three or four crops of corn can be\\r\\n    raised in a year.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"The Indian tribes, though savage, seem generally amiable, affable,\\r\\n    and obliging. They have no true idea of religion by a regular\\r\\n    worship. Tribes separated by not more than thirty miles, speak a\\r\\n    different language. And yet they manage to understand each other.\\r\\n    There is always some interpreter of one nation residing in another,\\r\\n    when they are allies, and who acts as a kind of consul. They are\\r\\n    very different from our Canada Indians, in their houses, dress,\\r\\n    manners, inclinations, and customs. They have large public squares,\\r\\n    games, assemblies. They seem mirthful and full of vivacity. Their\\r\\n    chiefs have absolute authority. No one would dare to pass between\\r\\n    the chief and the cane torch which burns in his cabin, and is\\r\\n    carried before him when he goes out. All make a circuit around it\\r\\n    with some ceremony.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"The chiefs have servants and officers, who follow them and wait\\r\\n    upon them everywhere. The chiefs distribute their favors at will.\\r\\n    In a word, we generally found them to be men. We saw none who knew\\r\\n    the use of fire-arms. They had no iron or steel articles, using\\r\\n    only stone knives and hatchets.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis wonderful expedition was accomplished without the loss of a single\\r\\nlife, on the part of the voyagers. Not one was even wounded. Father\\r\\nMembrÃ© attributes this, next to God\\'s goodness, to the tact and wisdom\\r\\nmanifested by La Salle. As to the missionary fruits of this enterprise,\\r\\nthe devoted ecclesiastic writes:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"I will say nothing here of conversions. Formerly the apostles had\\r\\n    but to enter a country, when on the first publication of the\\r\\n    Gospel, conversions were seen. I am but a miserable sinner,\\r\\n    infinitely destitute of the merits of the apostles. We must\\r\\n    acknowledge that these miraculous ways of grace are not attached to\\r\\n    the exercise of our ministry. God employs an ordinary and common\\r\\n    way, following which, I contented myself with announcing, as well\\r\\n    as I could, the principal truths of Christianity to the nations I\\r\\n    met. The Illinois language served me for about three hundred miles\\r\\n    down the river. I made the rest understand by gestures, and some\\r\\n    term in their dialect which I insensibly picked up. But I cannot\\r\\n    say that my feeble efforts produced certain fruits. With regard to\\r\\n    these people, perhaps some one, by a secret effect of grace, has\\r\\n    profited, God only knows. All we have done has been to see the\\r\\n    state of these tribes, and to open the way to the Gospel, and to\\r\\n    missionaries.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIII.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Sea Voyage to the Gulf of Mexico._\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle returns to Quebec.

Adventures in the\\r\\nCaribbean Sea. They Enter the Gulf. Storms and Calms. The Voyagers\\r\\nLost.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFather MembrÃ©\\'s journal abruptly terminates with the arrival of the\\r\\nparty at Fort Miami. We have no detailed account of the adventures of\\r\\nLa Salle during the next eight or ten months. We learn incidentally,\\r\\nthat Father MembrÃ© was sent to Quebec, and thence to France, to convey\\r\\nto the court the tidings of the great discovery, and of the annexation\\r\\nof truly imperial realms to the kingdom of Louis XIV. On the 8th of\\r\\nOctober, Father MembrÃ© left Fort Miami for Quebec. Thence he sailed\\r\\nwith Governor Frontenac for France, where he arrived before the close\\r\\nof the year. La Salle remained with the Miami and the Illinois Indians,\\r\\nprobably retrieving his fallen fortunes by extensive traffic in furs,\\r\\nof which he had, at the time, a monopoly conferred upon him by the\\r\\nking.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length, in the autumn of 1683, he also returned to Quebec, and\\r\\nsailed for France, landing at Rochelle on the 13th of December. No man\\r\\ncan, in this world, accomplish great results without exposing himself\\r\\nto malignant attacks. Bitter enemies assailed La Salle with venomous\\r\\nhostility. Their hostility was excited by the monopoly of the fur\\r\\ntrade, which he enjoyed over all the vast regions he had explored. They\\r\\ndespatched atrocious charges against him to the government, denouncing\\r\\nhim as a robber, and denying the discoveries which he professed to have\\r\\nmade. But Governor Frontenac and Father MembrÃ© were both at Versailles,\\r\\nand La Salle\\'s cause was not seriously injured by these malignant\\r\\ncharges.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the chevalier\\'s object, in this his return to France, to\\r\\norganize a colony to form a settlement in the earthly paradise which he\\r\\nthought that he had discovered on the banks of the Mississippi. He\\r\\ndesigned to arrange an expedition of such magnitude as would enable him\\r\\nto establish several permanent settlements, and also to explore more\\r\\nextensively the newly discovered country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king and the court entered eagerly into plans, which promised to\\r\\nredound greatly to the glory of France. The reputation of La Salle, the\\r\\ngrandeur of the undertaking, and a natural curiosity to visit scenes so\\r\\nfull of novelty and wonders, induced several gentlemen of distinction\\r\\nand intelligence to embark in the enterprise. Among them was a younger\\r\\nbrother of La Salle, with an ecclesiastic called M. Cavalier, and also\\r\\na nephew. The king conferred a new commission upon La Salle, investing\\r\\nhim with the powers almost of viceroyalty. The whole valley of the\\r\\nMississippi, from Lake Michigan to the Gulf, was called Louisiana, in\\r\\nhonor of the then reigning king. The sway of La Salle embraced the\\r\\nwhole of this almost limitless region. Seven missionaries accompanied\\r\\nthe expedition, under the general supervision of Father MembrÃ©, whose\\r\\nvirtues and eminent qualification for the station all alike recognized.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour vessels were equipped for the expedition. The first, called the\\r\\nJoli, was a man-of-war armed with thirty-six guns. The second was a\\r\\nfrigate called the Belle. The king made a present of this vessel to La\\r\\nSalle. He had furnished it with a very complete outfit, and with an\\r\\narmament of six guns. The third, called the Aimable, was a\\r\\nmerchant-ship of about three hundred tons. It was heavily laden with\\r\\nall those implements and goods which it was deemed would be most useful\\r\\nin the establishment of a colony. The fourth was a light, swift-sailing\\r\\nyacht, called the St. Francis, of but thirty tons. This vessel was also\\r\\nladen with munitions, supplies, and goods for traffic with the Indians.\\r\\nThe whole number who embarked, including one hundred soldiers and seven\\r\\nor eight families of women and children, amounted to two hundred and\\r\\neighty. Care was taken to select good mechanics for the various trades.\\r\\nBut, unfortunately, soldiers and seamen were engaged without apparently\\r\\nany reference to character. Thus some of the worst vagabonds of earth\\r\\nwere gathered from the seaports of France to colonize the New World.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing with the quarrelsome race of man ever goes smoothly for any\\r\\nconsiderable length of time. Captain Beaujeu, a Norman seaman of great\\r\\nvalor and extensive experience, was commander of the man-of-war, and,\\r\\nas such, was intrusted with the general direction and supervision of\\r\\nthe vessels. He was a proud man, accustomed to authority, and he\\r\\nregarded La Salle and his party as passengers, whom he was conveying to\\r\\ntheir destination, and who, while on board his vessels, were to be\\r\\nsubservient to his will.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, La Salle regarded Beaujeu as one of his officers,\\r\\nwho was to be implicitly obedient to his directions. The idea never\\r\\noccurred to him that Beaujeu was to be taken into partnership, or\\r\\nconsulted even, in regard to any of his measures, any farther than La\\r\\nSalle might deem it expedient to consult him or any other of his\\r\\nsubordinates. With views so different, a speedy quarrel was inevitable.\\r\\nBeaujeu is represented as a man full of conceit, of narrow mind, and\\r\\nvery irritable. La Salle was reserved, self-reliant, keeping his own\\r\\ncounsel. Scarcely had the two men met, before they found themselves in\\r\\nantagonism. Before the vessels sailed, Beaujeu wrote to the king\\'s\\r\\nminister as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"You have ordered me, sir, to afford this enterprise every facility\\r\\n    in my power. I shall do so. But permit me to say that I take great\\r\\n    credit to myself for consenting to obey the orders of La Salle. I\\r\\n    believe him to be a worthy man, but he has never served in war\\r\\n    except against savages, and has no military rank. I, on the\\r\\n    contrary, have been thirteen years captain of a vessel, and have\\r\\n    served thirty years by sea and land.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"He tells me that, in case of his death, the command devolves on\\r\\n    Chevalier de Tonti. This is certainly hard for me to bear. Though I\\r\\n    am not now acquainted with the country, I must be a dull scholar\\r\\n    not to obtain an adequate knowledge of it in a month after my\\r\\n    arrival. I beg you therefore to give me a share in the command, so\\r\\n    that no military operation may be undertaken without consulting me.\\r\\n    Should we be attacked by the Spaniards, I am persuaded that men who\\r\\n    have never commanded in war could not resist them, as another could\\r\\n    do, who had been taught by experience.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n    Three weeks later, he wrote: \"The Joli is prepared for sea. I hope\\r\\n    to sail down the river to-morrow. It remains for M. La Salle to\\r\\n    sail when he is ready. He has said nothing to me of his designs.\\r\\n    As he is constantly changing his plans, I know not whether the\\r\\n    provisions will be enough for the enterprise. He is so jealous,\\r\\n    and so fearful that some one may penetrate his secrets, that I\\r\\n    have refrained from asking him any questions.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"I have already informed you how disagreeable it was for me to be\\r\\n    under the orders of M. de la Salle, who has no military rank. I\\r\\n    shall however obey him, without repugnance, if you send me orders\\r\\n    to that effect. But I beg that they may be such that he can impute\\r\\n    no fault to me should he fail to execute what he has undertaken. I\\r\\n    am induced to say this because he has intimated that it was my\\r\\n    design to thwart his plans. I wish you would inform me what is to\\r\\n    be done in regard to the soldiers. He pretends that, on our\\r\\n    arrival, they are to be put under his charge. My instructions do\\r\\n    not authorize this pretence. I am to afford all the aid in my\\r\\n    power, without endangering the safety of the vessels.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ministry paid no attention to these complaints. They probably\\r\\ndecided to leave the commanders to settle such questions among\\r\\nthemselves. The four vessels sailed from Rochelle on the 24th of July,\\r\\n1684. They had advanced but about one hundred and fifty miles when a\\r\\nviolent tempest overtook them. The Joli lost her bowsprit. Consequently\\r\\nthe little squadron returned to Rochefort. Having repaired damages, the\\r\\nfleet again set sail, on the 1st of August.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle and his _suite_, if we may so speak of his chosen companions,\\r\\nwere on board the Joli, which Captain Beaujeu commanded. On the 8th of\\r\\nAugust the fleet passed Cape Finisterre, the extreme northwestern point\\r\\nof Spain. On the 20th they reached the island of Madeira. Captain\\r\\nBeaujeu wished to land here, to take in a fresh supply of provisions.\\r\\nLa Salle said, emphatically, \"No!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have,\" he said, \"an ample supply of both food and water. To anchor\\r\\nthere will cause us a delay of six or eight days. It will reveal our\\r\\nenterprise to the Spaniards. It was not the intention of the king that\\r\\nwe should touch at that point.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBeaujeu was compelled to submit. But he was very angry and sullen. His\\r\\nsub-officers and sailors were also angry. Time was nothing to them, and\\r\\nthey were anticipating grand carousals in port. Sharp words were\\r\\ninterchanged, and the quarrel became more bitter. On the 24th they\\r\\nreached the influence of the trade winds, which blow continually from\\r\\neast to west. On the 6th of September they reached the Tropic of\\r\\nCancer. In crossing this line a custom had long prevailed of performing\\r\\na rite called baptism upon all on shipboard who then crossed for the\\r\\nfirst time. The indignity was inflicted upon all alike, without any\\r\\nregard to character or rank. But, by giving the sailors a rich treat,\\r\\none could secure for himself a little more moderation in the\\r\\nperformance of the revolting ceremony.\\r\\n\\r\\nA very stout sailor, generally the most gigantic man of the crew,\\r\\ngrotesquely dressed to represent Father Neptune, would come up over the\\r\\nbows of the vessel and seize his victim. First he would catechize him\\r\\nvery closely respecting his object in crossing the line; then he would\\r\\nexact an oath that he would never permit any one, when he was present,\\r\\nto enter the tropics without subjecting him to baptism. Then he would\\r\\ndash several bucketsful of salt water upon his head. This was the\\r\\nmildest form of performing the rite. If the subject for the baptism\\r\\nwere, for any reason, obnoxious to the sailors, his treatment was much\\r\\nmore severe. He was greased and tarred and shampooed, and shaved with\\r\\nan iron hoop, and treated, in all respects, very roughly.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn board this fleet, the passengers, including one hundred well-armed\\r\\nsoldiers, greatly exceeded the number of sailors. La Salle, learning\\r\\nthat the sailors were making great preparations for this baptism,\\r\\nresolved that he would not submit to such an indignity, and that his\\r\\ncompanions and followers should not be subjected to it. He therefore\\r\\nissued orders prohibiting the ceremony. This exasperated the sailors.\\r\\nBeaujeu openly advocated their cause. The seamen were compelled to\\r\\nsubmit. The antagonism between the two commanders was embittered.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 11th of September they reached the latitude of St. Domingo. A\\r\\ndead calm soon ensued. The ships floated as upon a sea of glass. One of\\r\\nthe soldiers died. After imposing religious rites, his body was\\r\\nconsigned to its ocean sepulchre. The calm was succeeded by a storm. In\\r\\nthe darkness and tumult of this tropical tempest the vessels lost sight\\r\\nof each other. Gradually the storm abated. The change of climate had\\r\\ncaused much sickness. Fifty were in hospital on board the Joli,\\r\\nincluding La Salle and both of the surgeons. On the 20th, the grand\\r\\nmountains of St. Helena hove in sight, and the majestic bay of Samana\\r\\nopened before them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt still required a sail of five days before they reached the Port de\\r\\nPaix, on the northwestern extremity of the island. Here there was a\\r\\nvery fine harbor, and here the French governor of the neighboring isle\\r\\nof Tortue had his residence. La Salle had letters to this governor, M.\\r\\nde Cussy, directing him to supply the fleet with everything it might\\r\\nneed, and which it was in his power to give. For some unexplained\\r\\nreason Beaujeu silently declined obeying these orders. In the night he\\r\\nsailed directly by the Port de Paix, and doubling Cape St. Nicholas, a\\r\\nhundred miles distant at the western extremity of the island, circled\\r\\naround to the southern shore, and on the 27th cast anchor in a small\\r\\nharbor called the Petit Guave. The voyage thus far, from Rochelle, had\\r\\noccupied fifty-eight days.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis unaccountable change of place for the rendezvous of the scattered\\r\\nvessels caused much embarrassment. We do not know what were the\\r\\nremonstrances of La Salle, or what was the defence of Beaujeu. The Joli\\r\\nhad scarcely cast anchor in this remote and silent bay, when a large\\r\\nsail-boat, containing twenty men, who had caught sight of the ship,\\r\\nentered the port, and informed La Salle that not only Governor Cussy\\r\\nwas at the Port de Paix, but also the Marquis of Laurent, who was\\r\\ngovernor-general of all the French West India Islands. This greatly\\r\\nincreased the chagrin of La Salle for an interview with them would have\\r\\ngreatly facilitated his operations.\\r\\n\\r\\nReligious ceremonies were, in a remarkable degree, blended with all\\r\\nthese explorations. The next day after the Joli cast anchor, all the\\r\\nship\\'s company was assembled for divine worship, to return thanks to\\r\\nGod for their prosperous voyage. La Salle, being convalescent, went\\r\\nashore with a boat\\'s crew to obtain some refreshments, and to send\\r\\nintelligence across the island, to the governor, of his arrival at Port\\r\\nde Paix. In this message he expressed intense regret that he had not\\r\\nbeen able to stop at Port de Paix, and entreated the governor, if it\\r\\nwere in his power, to visit his ship at Guave.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn consequence of the number of sick on board, they were all landed,\\r\\nshelters were reared for them, and they were refreshed with fresh\\r\\nvegetables, fruit, and exercise in the open air. La Salle was still\\r\\nvery feeble. A slow fever was consuming him. The conduct of Beaujeu\\r\\ncaused him the greatest embarrassment. We should infer from the\\r\\nnarrative of M. Joutel that there was no European settlement at the\\r\\nspot, and but very few native inhabitants, though all the natives were\\r\\nfriendly.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a few days two of the vessels which had been separated from the Joli\\r\\nby the storm, entered the bay, having probably learned from the\\r\\nnatives, as they coasted along the shore, where the ship was. The whole\\r\\nof the eastern portion of the island was then held by Spain. As the\\r\\nthree vessels were sailing along, two large boats, filled with armed\\r\\nSpaniards, pushed out from the shore and seized the smallest of the\\r\\nvessels--the St. Francis--and carried it off as a prize, with all its\\r\\ncrew. This was a very heavy loss, as it deprived the expedition of\\r\\nsupplies of which it stood greatly in need. The chagrin of La Salle was\\r\\nincreased by the reflection that had Beaujeu obeyed orders and entered\\r\\nPort de Paix, the fleet would have rendezvoused there in perfect\\r\\nsafety. The governor very loudly expressed his indignation, in view of\\r\\nthe conduct of Captain Beaujeu.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe state of mind of the captain may be inferred from the following\\r\\nextracts from a letter to the French minister, which he wrote at that\\r\\nplace:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Were it not the sickness of Chevalier La Salle, I should have no\\r\\n    occasion to write to you, as I am charged only with the navigation\\r\\n    and he with the secret. We have arrived here almost all sick. La\\r\\n    Salle has been attacked by a violent fever, which affects not more\\r\\n    his body than his mind. His brother requested me to take charge of\\r\\n    his affairs. I excused myself because I know that when restored to\\r\\n    health he would not approve of what I had done.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"It is said that the Spaniards have, in these seas, six men-of-war,\\r\\n    each carrying sixty guns. It is true that if the Chevalier de la\\r\\n    Salle should not recover, I shall pursue different measures from\\r\\n    those which he has adopted, which I do not approve. I cannot\\r\\n    comprehend how a man should dream of settling a country surrounded\\r\\n    by Spaniards and Indians, with a company of workmen and women,\\r\\n    without soldiers.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"If you will permit me to express my opinion, the Chevalier de la\\r\\n    Salle should have contented himself with the discovery of his\\r\\n    river, without attempting to conduct three vessels and troops\\r\\n    across the ocean through seas utterly unknown to him. He is a man\\r\\n    of great learning, who has read much, and has some knowledge of\\r\\n    navigation. But there is a great difference between theory and\\r\\n    practice. The ability to transport canoes through lakes and rivers\\r\\n    is very different from that which is required to conduct vessels\\r\\n    and troops over remote seas.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a short delay in this lonely harbor, the fleet, now consisting of\\r\\nbut three vessels, again spread its sails. It was agreed to direct\\r\\ntheir course to Cape St. Antoine, about nine hundred miles distant, at\\r\\nthe extreme western point of the island of Cuba. Should the vessels be\\r\\nseparated by a storm, they were to rendevous at that place.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Aimable, a heavily laden merchantman, was the slowest sailer, it\\r\\nwas decided that she should take the lead, the other two following. La\\r\\nSalle, with his brother, Father MembrÃ©, and some others, transferred\\r\\ntheir quarters from the Joli to the Aimable. This movement was also\\r\\nprobably influenced by La Salle\\'s desire to escape from the uncongenial\\r\\ncompanionship of Captain Beaujeu. It was on the 25th of November, 1684,\\r\\nthat the voyage was resumed.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo days\\' sail brought the fleet within sight of the magnificent island\\r\\nof Cuba. They ran along its southern shore, generally in sight of its\\r\\ntowering mountains and its luxuriant foliage, but having the enchanting\\r\\nscenery occasionally veiled from their view by dense fogs. On the 1st\\r\\nof December they caught sight, far away in the south, of the grand\\r\\nisland of Cayman. On the 4th of December, they cast anchor in a\\r\\nsheltered bay of the beautiful Island of Pines, but a few miles south\\r\\nof the Cuban coast.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle, with his companions, took a boat and went on shore. Several\\r\\nof the ship\\'s crew rowed the boat. As they approached the sandy beach,\\r\\nthey saw an immense crocodile, apparently asleep, enjoying the blaze of\\r\\na tropical sun. The boatmen drew near as noiselessly as they could. La\\r\\nSalle took deliberate aim and fired. Fortunately the bullet struck a\\r\\nvulnerable point. The monster, after a few convulsive struggles, was\\r\\ndead. The sailors, eager for a taste of fresh meat, kindled a fire and\\r\\nroasted the flesh, which they found tender and palatable. There were no\\r\\ninhabitants at that point. The party separated in small groups, and\\r\\nwandered in all directions, lured by the beauty of the region, and\\r\\nfeasting upon the rich tropical fruits which grew in spontaneous\\r\\nabundance.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen about to reÃ«mbark, two of the sailors were missing. Several guns\\r\\nwere fired as signals for the lost men, but in vain. The boat returned\\r\\nto the ship. The next morning, at sunrise, a boat\\'s crew of thirty men\\r\\nwas sent to search for the wanderers. At length they were found,\\r\\nthoroughly frightened, having passed a very uncomfortable night. The\\r\\nbeauty of this island charmed all who beheld it. They were lavish in\\r\\ntheir praises of its luxuriance, its fruits, its game, and its birds of\\r\\nbrilliant plumage.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain the fleet weighed anchor and, on the 11th, reached Cape\\r\\nCorrientes, one of the most prominent southwestern points of Cuba. Here\\r\\nagain they ran into a solitary bay, which, in clustering fruits and\\r\\nvine-draped bowers, and birds on the wing, presented an aspect of\\r\\nalmost Eden loveliness. They tarried but a day. Then, taking advantage\\r\\nof a breeze fresh and fair, they passed from the Caribbean Sea into the\\r\\nGulf of Mexico They had proceeded but about fifteen miles when the wind\\r\\nchanged, and became adverse. For two days, by beating, they worked\\r\\ntheir way slowly against it.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Beaujeu took a boat, and came on board the Aimable, and\\r\\ninsisted that the vessels should put back to Cape Antoine, and ride at\\r\\nanchor there until the wind should prove favorable. La Salle could not\\r\\nconsider this measure judicious. But, weary of contention and anxious\\r\\nto agree with Beaujeu whenever he could, he reluctantly gave his\\r\\nconsent. They ran back to the land, cast anchor, remained two days in a\\r\\ndead calm, when suddenly a tropical tempest arose, which was almost a\\r\\ntornado. The Belle dragged her anchor, and was driven violently against\\r\\nthe Aimable, carrying away her bowsprit, and greatly injuring much of\\r\\nher rigging. The Aimable would have been sunk had she not cut her cable\\r\\nand escaped. The anchor was lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 18th, the wind became fair. Having repaired damages as far as\\r\\nwas in their power, the fleet again set sail. It was ten o\\'clock in the\\r\\nmorning of a very delightful day. Directing their course northwesterly,\\r\\nthey sailed, with a gentle breeze and occasional calms, nine days\\'\\r\\nwithout seeing land or encountering any event of importance. On the\\r\\n28th, land was discovered. It was but a few miles distant. It was\\r\\nevidently the continent of North America, and consisted of a long reach\\r\\nof low land, fringed with a dense forest, and elevated but a few feet\\r\\nabove the level of the Gulf.\\r\\n\\r\\nA shallop was speedily equipped, and La Salle, with a few of his chosen\\r\\ncompanions and a boat\\'s crew, all well-armed, repaired to the shore to\\r\\nreconnoitre. Another boat, also similarly equipped, was ordered soon to\\r\\nfollow. The Belle was directed to keep up careful soundings, and to\\r\\nrange along the coast as near the shore as was safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle\\'s party soon reached the shore, and landed upon a very\\r\\nbeautiful meadow. But they had no time for exploration. The freshening\\r\\nwind rolled in such a surf that there was great danger that their boat\\r\\nwould be swamped. They were compelled hastily to reÃ«mbark, and return\\r\\nto the ship. Slowly the vessels coasted along the uninviting shore,\\r\\nlooking in vain for any inlet or any river\\'s mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 2d of January, 1685, a dense fog settled down over the sea and\\r\\nthe land, so enveloping the ships that no object could be seen at the\\r\\ndistance of a few yards.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle ordered cannon occasionally to be fired on board the Aimable,\\r\\nto let the other two vessels know where he was. As there was scarcely a\\r\\nbreath of wind, there was no necessity that the fleet should be\\r\\nscattered. When the fog the next day was dissipated, the Joli was not\\r\\nin sight. Toward evening, however, the ship was again seen. In a few\\r\\ndays they discovered an inlet, which La Salle carefully examined from\\r\\nthe mast-head. He judged it to be the Bay of Appalachicola, then called\\r\\nEspiritu Santo, on the Florida coast. They therefore pressed on\\r\\nwesterly, hoping soon to reach the Mississippi.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo make it sure that he should not pass the mouth of the river, which,\\r\\nflowing through very low and marshy soil, was designated by no\\r\\nlandmark, La Salle desired to send a party of thirty men ashore to\\r\\nfollow along the coast. But the wind rose, and the surf dashed so\\r\\nviolently upon the muddy banks, that a landing could not be effected.\\r\\nSlowly the fleet moved along until the 13th, when it was found\\r\\nnecessary to land to take in water. A shallop was sent ashore, with\\r\\nfive or six seamen, well-armed. There was no inlet, and no creek to\\r\\nafford any protection, and the surf still rolled in heavily.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the dense forest spread its gloom far and wide around, there\\r\\nopened before them a small meadow of but a few acres, green, treeless\\r\\nand smooth as a floor. The boat was directed toward that spot. When\\r\\nwithin a gun-shot of the land, a troop of about a dozen savages, tall,\\r\\nstalwart men, entirely naked, emerged from the forest, and came down to\\r\\nthe water\\'s edge. The surf was so high that there was much danger that\\r\\nthe boat would be swamped in an attempt to land. The seamen therefore\\r\\ncast anchor, to consider what was to be done.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the savages saw that they were at a standstill, they made friendly\\r\\nsigns, inviting the strangers to land. They waded out into the surf and\\r\\nbeckoned to them. Apparently the boat could not pass safely through the\\r\\nsurf. There was a large amount of drift-wood lining the shore. Several\\r\\nof the savages selected a large smooth log. This they pushed through\\r\\nthe surf. Ranging themselves on each side, they clung to the log with\\r\\none arm, while, with the other, they paddled. Without any hesitancy,\\r\\nunarmed and helpless, they clambered into the boat.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen five were in, the seamen motioned to the others to go to another\\r\\nboat which was then approaching, and which conveyed La Salle. The\\r\\nsavages seemed not to entertain the slightest suspicion of danger. La\\r\\nSalle was very glad to receive them. He hoped that they could give him\\r\\nsome information respecting the river he sought. But all his efforts\\r\\nwere in vain. Though he spoke several Indian languages, he could not\\r\\nmake them understand him. They were all taken on board the vessel. With\\r\\nmuch curiosity they examined its wonders. They were feasted, and seemed\\r\\nquite at home in smoking the pipe of fragrant tobacco. The sheep, the\\r\\nswine, and the poultry, they had evidently never seen before. But when\\r\\nthey were shown the skin of a cow, which had recently been killed, they\\r\\nseemed much delighted, and indicated that they had seen such animals\\r\\nbefore, doubtless referring to the buffaloes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving received many presents, a boat was sent to carry them as near\\r\\nthe shore as it was safe to go. The savages bound their presents upon\\r\\ntheir heads, and letting themselves gently down into the water, swam to\\r\\nthe land. Marvellous must have been the stories which they narrated\\r\\nthat night, in their wigwams, to admiring crowds. Quite a large group\\r\\nof Indians was seen gathered upon the shore to greet them, as they came\\r\\nback.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle had found it impossible to understand their signs. But his\\r\\napprehensions were somewhat excited by the thought that they might have\\r\\nendeavored to indicate to him that he had already passed the mouth of\\r\\nthe Mississippi.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat evening the wind rose fresh and fair. Raising their anchors, and\\r\\nkeeping near the shore, with frequent soundings, they pressed on toward\\r\\nthe southwest. The next day came a dead calm. Each vessel floated on\\r\\nthe glassy sea, \"like a painted ship on a painted ocean.\" Thus they\\r\\nmoved along, day after day, encountering calms, when not a ripple was\\r\\nto be seen on the mirrored expanse, and fresh breezes, which tossed the\\r\\nocean in billowy foam, and storms which threatened to tear the masts\\r\\nfrom the hulls.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 14th of January they attempted again to effect a landing in the\\r\\nboats. But the surf prevented. They saw, however, upon a beautiful\\r\\nprairie, extending with its waving grass and gorgeous flowers as far as\\r\\nthe eye could reach, vast herds of wild horses and buffaloes. All on\\r\\nboard the vessels were greatly excited by this spectacle. They were\\r\\neager to land, that they might enjoy the pleasure of an encampment and\\r\\nthe excitement of hunting and the chase.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe land was now found trending more and more to the south. They had\\r\\nreached a latitude considerably below that of the mouth of the\\r\\nMississippi, as ascertained by La Salle, upon his first visit. The\\r\\nwhole aspect of the country seemed changed. There were immense treeless\\r\\nprairies continually opening before them, crowded with game, and\\r\\nespecially with immense herds of horses and buffaloes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length they came to apparently the mouth of a small river. A boat\\r\\nwas sent on shore, with orders to kindle a fire, as a signal, should\\r\\nthey find a good place for landing. La Salle stood upon the deck of the\\r\\nAimable, eagerly watching. Soon he saw the smoke curling up through the\\r\\nclear air of the prairie. Just as La Salle was entering his boat for\\r\\nthe shore, the wind freshened and tumbled in such billows from the open\\r\\nsea that the boat, which had already landed, was compelled\\r\\nprecipitately to return. The next morning the wind abated La Salle felt\\r\\nhimself lost. He resolved to land, with a strong party, and make a\\r\\nthorough exploration of the region, that he might, by observation or by\\r\\ncommunication with such inhabitants as he might discover, find out\\r\\nwhere he was. He had many apprehensions that he had passed the mouth of\\r\\nthe Mississippi, and that he was far in the west, skirting the coast of\\r\\nMexico.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIV.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Lost in the Wilderness._\\r\\n\\r\\nTreachery of Beaujeu.

The\\r\\nMississippi sought for in vain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe altercation between La Salle and Beaujeu still continued. The\\r\\nchevalier feared that the captain designed to abandon him and return to\\r\\nFrance. Parties were formed, and the dispute on board the vessels was\\r\\nbitter. La Salle was convinced that he had passed the Mississippi.\\r\\nOthers argued that they had not reached it. In fact they were beyond\\r\\nMatagorda Bay, in the southwestern part of Texas, and were within a\\r\\nhundred miles of the Rio Grande. A dense fog prevented the landing of\\r\\nthe boat\\'s crew. La Salle insisting upon a return, the vessels coasted\\r\\nslowly along, a distance of about thirty miles, till they came to an\\r\\ninlet, which the fog had prevented them from seeing before, and which\\r\\nproved to be Matagorda Bay.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe expedition was now in serious trouble. Their provisions were nearly\\r\\nexhausted. They had thus far seen no settlement, on the American coast,\\r\\nfrom which they could obtain supplies. A large party was landed on the\\r\\nwestern entrance of the bay. They threw up a camp, and while some\\r\\nexplored the prairie with their guns, others followed up the stream\\r\\nwith their fishing rods. An ample supply of game, of great variety, was\\r\\ntaken, and also an abundance of fish. All who could be spared from the\\r\\nships hastened to the shore. The weather was delightful; the scenery\\r\\nenchanting; and the whole ship\\'s company, after so long an imprisonment\\r\\nin the crowded vessels, revelled in feasting and joy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Uneasy lies the head which wears a crown.\" La Salle, feeling keenly\\r\\nhis responsibility for the success of the expedition, was heavily\\r\\noppressed by care. One of the boats was sent up the bay, seven or eight\\r\\nmiles, in search of a river or brook; but their search was in vain. A\\r\\nfew springs of tolerably good water were found, from which they\\r\\nreplenished their empty barrels. Ducks and other water-fowl were met in\\r\\ngreat abundance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vessels were all anchored in the bay, near the shore, and for\\r\\nseveral days, in this sunny region, beneath cloudless skies, the\\r\\nvoyagers generally enjoyed all the pleasures of the most delightful\\r\\npicnic party. La Salle saw increasing evidence that Beaujeu was\\r\\nintending to desert him. He was anxious to lay in supplies for a long\\r\\nvoyage. La Salle wished to delay only to obtain provisions for fifteen\\r\\ndays. He was satisfied that it would not take longer than that to\\r\\nreturn to the point where he now believed the mouth of the Mississippi\\r\\nto be.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this emergence he decided to have the vessels coast along near the\\r\\nshore, while he sent a chosen party of one hundred and thirty men, to\\r\\nmarch along upon the land. The adventurous band commenced its journey\\r\\nin a fog so dense that those in the rear could not see those in front.\\r\\nM. Joutel, the historian of the expedition from the time it sailed from\\r\\nFrance until its close, led this party.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe march was commenced on the 5th of February. Each man carried his\\r\\npack upon his own shoulders. They kept along as near as possible to the\\r\\nsea. The first night they encamped on a slight eminence, where a large\\r\\nfire was built to signalize to the vessels their position. For a week\\r\\nthey thus journeyed along, through marsh and prairie and forest,\\r\\nbuilding each night their signal fires. During all this time they\\r\\ncaught no sight of their vessels. On the 13th they came to the banks of\\r\\na wide creek or bayou, which they had no means of crossing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe carpenters were immediately set to work in building a boat. The\\r\\nnext day, while thus employed, the Joli and the Belle hove in sight.\\r\\nThe short twilight of the tropics was then passing into night. A\\r\\nsignal-fire was built, and seen by those on the ships. The next\\r\\nmorning, the slow-sailing Aimable, which bore La Salle and his\\r\\ncompanions, appeared. La Salle landed and visited the encampment.\\r\\nHaving sounded the creek, he decided to bring the three vessels in, and\\r\\nto send a boat to explore inland, hoping that the creek might prove to\\r\\nbe the mouth of some river. The channel was carefully staked out for\\r\\nthe entrance of the vessels, safe anchorage chosen, and orders were\\r\\nissued for the three to enter at the next high tide. La Salle would\\r\\ngive the signal from the shore, when they were to move.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Beaujeu sent back the insolent answer, \"I can manage my own\\r\\nvessel without any instructions from Monsieur La Salle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs this message arrived, a party of the ship\\'s company, who had been at\\r\\nsome distance from the camp, came running in, much alarmed, saying that\\r\\nquite an army of savages was approaching. La Salle instantly called all\\r\\nhis force to arms, that he might be prepared for any emergence. Though\\r\\nearnestly desirous of peace, he yet deemed it important to show a bold\\r\\nfront. In imposing military array, with muskets loaded, and the beating\\r\\nof drums, he led his band of about one hundred and fifty men, to meet\\r\\nthe Indians.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth parties halted and faced each other, neither knowing whether the\\r\\nother wished for peace or war. La Salle directed ten of his men to lay\\r\\ndown their arms, and advance toward the Indians, making friendly signs,\\r\\nand endeavoring to invite an unarmed party to meet them. The whole body\\r\\nat once threw down their arms, consisting of bows and javelins, and ran\\r\\nforward joyously, caressing the Europeans, according to their custom,\\r\\nby rubbing their hands first over their own breasts and arms, and then\\r\\nover the breasts and arms of their newly found friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nSix or seven accompanied a party of the French back to their\\r\\nencampment. La Salle, with the rest, accepted an invitation to visit\\r\\nthe Indian village, which they represented as distant about five miles.\\r\\nJust as they were starting, La Salle turned his eyes toward the bay,\\r\\nwhen he saw, much to his consternation, that their store-ship the\\r\\nAimable, which was left under the care of Captain Beaujeu, instead of\\r\\nfollowing the channel marked out by the stakes, was paying no regard to\\r\\nthem. He was greatly alarmed; but there was nothing which he could do\\r\\nto repel the danger.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe therefore, though in great perturbation, followed the savages to\\r\\ntheir village. It consisted of about fifty wigwams, erected upon an\\r\\neminence but slightly elevated above the level prairie. The huts were\\r\\nbuilt of mats or of the tanned skins of the buffalo. Just as they were\\r\\nentering the village, a cannon was fired from one of the ships. The\\r\\nsavages were greatly terrified, and simultaneously threw themselves\\r\\nupon the ground, burying their faces in the grass. But La Salle\\r\\nreassured them, stating that it was merely a signal to him that one of\\r\\nhis ships had come to anchor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough La Salle was very vigilant to guard against any treachery, still\\r\\nthe hospitality manifested by the Indians seemed sincere and cordial.\\r\\nThe Indians feasted them abundantly with fresh buffalo steaks, and\\r\\njerked meat consisting of thin slices of flesh dried in the sun and\\r\\nsmoked. Their village was near the creek, and La Salle counted forty\\r\\nlarge boats, made of logs hollowed out, such as he had seen on the\\r\\nMississippi.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon returning to the camp, La Salle found his worst fears realized.\\r\\nThe Aimable was driven aground, and under circumstances which rendered\\r\\nit almost certain that it had been done through the treachery of\\r\\nCaptain Beaujeu. La Salle had marked out the channel by stakes, had\\r\\nsent the vessel a pilot, whom Beaujeu had refused to receive, and had\\r\\nstationed a man at the mast-head, who had given a loud warning, but\\r\\nwhose cry was entirely disregarded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Those who witnessed the manoeuvre,\" writes Joutel, \"were convinced,\\r\\nby irresistible evidence, that the vessel was wrecked by design, which\\r\\nwas one of the blackest and most detestable crimes which can enter into\\r\\nthe human heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vessel was run upon the shore at the highest tide. All efforts to\\r\\nfloat her again were unavailing. The calamity was irretrievable. The\\r\\nAimable contained all the ammunition, the mechanic tools, and the\\r\\nfarming and household utensils. But La Salle, ever rising superior to\\r\\nthe blows of misfortune, still retained his firmness. Diligently he\\r\\nengaged in removing the stores from the wrecked ship. One of the\\r\\nshallops had been, as it was believed, treacherously destroyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the one shallop which remained, he succeeded, that afternoon, in\\r\\nremoving from the ship to an encampment on the shore, the ammunition, a\\r\\nconsiderable portion of the mechanic tools, the farming and domestic\\r\\nutensils, and a few barrels of provisions. During the night a storm\\r\\narose. The vessel was dashed to pieces. In the morning the bay was\\r\\ncovered with barrels, chests, bales, and other dÃ©bris of the wreck.\\r\\nWhile affairs were in this deplorable state, the savages, about one\\r\\nhundred and twenty in number, made another visit to the camp. The\\r\\nshores were strewed with articles of inestimable value to these poor\\r\\nIndians. Sentinels were stationed to prevent any robbery; but the\\r\\nIndians manifested no disposition to perpetrate any acts of violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle was in great want of more boats. The Indians had some, which\\r\\nwere dug out from immense trunks of trees, of graceful form and rich\\r\\ncarving, capable of carrying twenty or thirty men. As all the work on\\r\\nthese boats had been performed with stone hatchets, almost an infinity\\r\\nof labor had been expended upon them, and they were deemed very\\r\\nvaluable.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle sent two trusty men to the village of the Indians, to\\r\\npurchase, if they could, two of the boats. When they entered the\\r\\nwigwams, they found that a bale of blankets, which had drifted along\\r\\nthe bay, had been picked up by the Indians, and divided among them.\\r\\nThey made no attempt at concealment. Not having any clear views of the\\r\\nrights of property, they had no thought that they had done anything\\r\\nwrong in taking goods which they had found drifting in the water. The\\r\\nofficers returned to La Salle with this report.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuffering from shipwreck and great destitution, it was necessary for\\r\\nhim to economize, as much as possible, in his expenditures. He\\r\\ntherefore decided to send some men to the Indians, to endeavor to\\r\\nobtain two boats in exchange for the blankets and a few other articles\\r\\nwhich they had picked up. M. Hamel, one of Beaujeu\\'s officers,\\r\\nvolunteered to go on this mission, with a boat\\'s crew, in the shallop\\r\\nof the Joli. He was an impetuous young fellow, with more bravery than\\r\\nprudence. Assuming that the Indians had stolen the blankets, and that\\r\\nthey were to be browbeaten and forced to make restitution by the\\r\\nsurrender of two of their boats, he advanced, upon his landing, in such\\r\\nmenacing military array as to frighten the Indians. Most of them fled\\r\\ninto the woods.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe entered the deserted cabins, picked up all the blankets he could\\r\\nfind, stole a number of very nicely tanned deer skins, and then,\\r\\nseizing two of the best boats, put men on board of each, and commenced\\r\\nhis return to the ship. He was quite elated with his performance,\\r\\nthinking it a heroic achievement. As they were paddling slowly down the\\r\\nbay, the wind rose strongly against them. Night came on cold and dark.\\r\\nIt became necessary to land and wait for the morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey built a large fire. Wrapped in blankets, they threw themselves\\r\\nupon the grass around, with their feet toward the glowing coals, and\\r\\nsoon all fell asleep. Sentinels had been stationed at a short distance\\r\\nfrom the fire, but they slept also.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indians returned to their wigwams. They found their treasures gone\\r\\nand two of their best boats stolen. As night came, they saw in the\\r\\ndistance the light of a camp fire, and understood full well what it\\r\\nsignified. With silent tread, and breathing vengeance, they crept\\r\\nthrough the forest upon their sleeping foes. At a given signal, the\\r\\nforest resounded with the dreadful war-whoop, and a shower of arrows\\r\\nfell upon the sleepers. Two were killed outright; two were severely\\r\\nwounded. The rest sprung to their arms, while some fled in terror.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indians, aware of the terrible power of the white man\\'s musket, did\\r\\nnot wait for a battle. Having inflicted this deed of revenge, they\\r\\nsuddenly disappeared. One of the men, M. Moranget, a nephew of La\\r\\nSalle, succeeded in reaching the encampment of his friends, though\\r\\nfaint and bleeding. One arrow had inflicted a terrible wound, almost\\r\\ncutting its way through his shoulder. Another had cut a deep gash along\\r\\nhis bosom.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle immediately sent an armed party to the spot. He was\\r\\nexceedingly chagrined by the cruel blunder perpetrated by his envoy.\\r\\nThough he could not blame the Indians, he knew full well that, their\\r\\nvengeance being thus aroused, they would, if they could, doom all to\\r\\nindiscriminate slaughter. It was necessary for him therefore to take\\r\\nthe most decisive action in self-defence. The dead were buried. One\\r\\nman, helplessly wounded, was brought back to the camp. The others\\r\\nreturned unharmed. This disaster took place in the night of the 5th of\\r\\nMarch, 1685.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese calamities operated fearfully against La Salle. Beaujeu took\\r\\nadvantage of them, and lost no opportunity of proclaiming them as\\r\\nevidence that La Salle was utterly incompetent to conduct such an\\r\\nenterprise as that in which he was engaged. Quite a number, who had\\r\\nformerly been friends of La Salle, ranged themselves on the side of\\r\\nBeaujeu, who now openly proclaimed his intention of abandoning the\\r\\nenterprise and returning to France. Still he continued to do everything\\r\\nin his power to embarrass the operations of La Salle. There were\\r\\nseveral pieces of cannon on board the Belle. But nearly all the cannon\\r\\nballs were in the hold of the Joli. Beaujeu, on the eve of his\\r\\ndeparture, refused to give them up, saying that it was inconvenient for\\r\\nhim to get at them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout the 14th of March, Captain Beaujeu spread the sails of the Joli,\\r\\nand disappeared over the horizon of the sea, on his voyage to France.\\r\\nHe took with him sixty or seventy of the company, and many stores which\\r\\nwere deemed essential in the establishment of a colony. La Salle was\\r\\nleft with about two hundred men, encamped upon the banks of an unknown\\r\\ninlet, and with one single small vessel, the Belle, anchored in the\\r\\nbay. To add to the gloom of his situation, the Indians were justly\\r\\nexasperated against him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first thing to be done was to build a fort for defence. Thinking it\\r\\nnot impossible that the broad creek he had entered might prove to be\\r\\none of the mouths of the Mississippi, he decided to set out on an\\r\\nexploring tour up the river for some distance into the interior. Five\\r\\nboats, containing a well-armed party of about fifty persons, embarked\\r\\nupon this enterprise. La Salle himself took the command. About one\\r\\nhundred and forty persons were left behind in the fort, under the\\r\\ncontrol of M. Joutel. Those who were left in garrison, were to employ\\r\\ntheir time in strengthening the fort, and in building a large boat on\\r\\nthe European plan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe savages came frequently around the encampment at night, barking\\r\\nlike dogs and howling like wolves. They did not venture upon any\\r\\nattack. Upon one occasion, however, a few men were at work at a little\\r\\ndistance from the encampment, when they saw a large band of savages\\r\\napproaching. The workmen fled to the fort, leaving all their tools\\r\\nbehind them. The savages gathered them up and retired. It was not safe\\r\\nto wander far for game. But fish was taken in great abundance from the\\r\\nbay.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in April, the garrison was alarmed by the sight of a distant\\r\\nsail. It was feared that it was a war-ship of the hostile Spaniards,\\r\\ncoming to destroy them. The vessel, however, passed by, without\\r\\napparently seeing the encampment. Several tragic incidents ensued. One\\r\\nman was bitten by a rattlesnake. After suffering dreadful agonies he\\r\\ndied. Another, who was fishing, was swept away by the current and was\\r\\ndrowned. Fortunately, beds of excellent salt were found, formed by the\\r\\nevaporation of salt water in basins on the land.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt must be confessed that the savages manifested much of a Christian\\r\\ndisposition. They frequently came near the fort, and made signs\\r\\nindicative of their desire that friendly relations might be restored.\\r\\nBut La Salle, fearing treachery, and not having full confidence in the\\r\\nprudence of those he left behind, gave orders that no intercourse\\r\\nshould be opened with the savages until his return.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in May, quite a large party of Indians appeared near the fort.\\r\\nThree of them, laying aside their weapons, came forward and made signs\\r\\nthat they wished for a conference. M. Joutel, instead of sending three\\r\\nunarmed men to meet them, invited them to come into the fort. Though\\r\\nthey thus placed themselves entirely in his power, they, without the\\r\\nslightest hesitation, entered the enclosure. They quietly sat down,\\r\\nand, by signs, said that hunters from the fort had often been near\\r\\nthem, so that they could easily have killed them. But they refrained\\r\\nfrom doing them any injury. M. Moranget, who had been so severely\\r\\nwounded, urged that they should be terribly punished, in revenge for\\r\\nthe attack upon the camp. This infamous proposal M. Joutel rejected.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut his conduct was inexcusable. He gave them a very unfriendly\\r\\nreception; and soon ordered them to depart. They had scarcely left the\\r\\nentrance gate, when he ordered several muskets to be fired, as if at\\r\\nthem. They thought that they were treacherously fired upon, and fled\\r\\nprecipitately. He then ordered several cannon-shot to be thrown to the\\r\\neminence, where the large party was peacefully assembled. This\\r\\nscattered them. Such was the response to the Indians\\' appeal for\\r\\nfriendship. Thus insanely did the garrison establish open hostilities\\r\\nbetween the two parties, when it was evident that the Indians desired\\r\\nfriendship.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle, in ascending the river, found a prairie region far more rich\\r\\nand beautiful than that occupied by the encampment at the mouth of the\\r\\ncreek. He sent back two boats, with directions that about thirty of the\\r\\nmost able-bodied men should remain to garrison the fort, while the\\r\\nrest, including all the women and children, were to embark, under M.\\r\\nMoranget, for the new location. Early in July another messenger came\\r\\nwith instructions for all the remaining garrison to embark, with all\\r\\nthe stores they could carry, in the Belle, and ascend the river many\\r\\nleagues, to join their companions in the new settlement, and to bury,\\r\\nin careful concealment, all the goods which could not be removed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut sorrows and troubles without number came. The blazing sun of summer\\r\\nwithered them. Many were sick. All were languid, discontented,\\r\\ndisheartened. The wood to build their huts had to be drawn three miles\\r\\nby hand. There was no heart for the work. Discontented men always\\r\\nquarrel. Even La Salle lost hope, and no longer displayed his customary\\r\\nenergy and sagacity. Those who had professed to be good\\r\\nhouse-carpenters, were found to be totally ignorant of their business.\\r\\nFood became scarce. More than thirty in a few weeks died. These funeral\\r\\nscenes spread gloom over the whole encampment, and all wished\\r\\nthemselves back in France.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle could intrust weighty responsibilities to no one. He was\\r\\ncompelled to superintend everything, and even to devote himself to the\\r\\nminutest details.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle called this river La Vache, or Cow River, in consequence of\\r\\nthe vast number of buffalo cows in which he saw grazing upon the banks.\\r\\nThe spot chosen for the village or encampment, if we can judge from the\\r\\ndescription of M. Joutel, must have been quite enchanting. There was an\\r\\nelevated expanse, smooth and fertile, raised many feet above the level\\r\\nof the stream. An undulating prairie, covered with waving grass and\\r\\nflowers, spread far away for leagues toward the north and the west,\\r\\nbordered, in the distance, by forest-covered hills. The river flowed\\r\\nplacidly upon the east, entering into the long and wide bay upon the\\r\\nsouth. Nothing could exceed the beauty of the prairie, waving in the\\r\\nrichest bloom of flowers of every variety of tint.\\r\\n\\r\\nA large cellar was dug, that the ammunition and other valuables might\\r\\nbe stored beneath the ground, as a protection against fire. La Salle,\\r\\nwith a few companions, made several excursions of fifteen or twenty\\r\\nmiles into the country, hoping to find the Mississippi, or some Indians\\r\\nwho could give him information upon that point. Failing in all these,\\r\\nhe decided upon a more extensive exploration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe property at the settlement now consisted of only two hundred\\r\\nmuskets, two hundred swords, one hundred kegs of powder, three thousand\\r\\npounds of bullets, three hundred pounds of lead, several bars of steel\\r\\nand of iron to be hammered into nails, and a tolerable supply of\\r\\nfarming and mechanic tools. They had no ploughs, horses, or oxen.\\r\\nWithout these, farming could be carried on only upon a very limited\\r\\nscale. They had, however, twenty barrels of flour, a puncheon and a\\r\\nhalf of wine, a few gallons of brandy, one or two swine, and one cock\\r\\nand hen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exploring party of fifty set out in two bands, in October, from the\\r\\nbay, which he had named St. Louis. M. Joutel was left in command at the\\r\\nsettlement, with the strictest injunctions to have no intercourse with\\r\\nthe Indians. One band ascended the river in boats. The other followed\\r\\nalong upon the shore. Having ascended the river many leagues, and being\\r\\nfully convinced that it was not a branch of the Mississippi, they drew\\r\\ntheir boats upon the eastern shore, and all commenced their march, over\\r\\nthe boundless prairies, with packs upon their backs, toward the rising\\r\\nsun.\\r\\n\\r\\nEre long they saw in the distance an Indian village, consisting of a\\r\\ncluster of thirty or forty wigwams. It was delightfully situated. The\\r\\nIndians, in locating their villages, ever had a keen sense of landscape\\r\\nbeauty. It is difficult to account for the fact that, under the\\r\\nleadership of La Salle, there should have been a battle. But it was so.\\r\\nWe have no explanation of the circumstances. After a brief conflict,\\r\\nthe savages fled, many being wounded and probably some killed, for they\\r\\nwere accustomed to carry their dead with them on a retreat.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle and his party entered the abandoned village. They found,\\r\\ncowering in one of the wigwams, a woman who had been struck by a bullet\\r\\nin the neck, and who was dying. A young girl was with her. Just after\\r\\nthis, La Salle sent a party of six men to explore a stream. After a\\r\\ntoilsome day the party encamped for the night. They built their fire,\\r\\ncooked their supper, and, without establishing any watch, wrapped\\r\\nthemselves in their blankets for sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day they did not return. La Salle\\'s anxieties were roused. He\\r\\nset out in search of them. The dead bodies of the six were found,\\r\\npierced with arrows, scalped, and half devoured by wolves. The details\\r\\nof this midnight tragedy were never known. Saddened by this calamity,\\r\\nyet striving to maintain cheerful spirits, the party pressed on their\\r\\nway. After many days\\' march they came to another large river, which\\r\\nproved to be that which is now known as the Colorado, which empties\\r\\ninto Matagorda Bay, more than four hundred miles west of the mouths of\\r\\nthe Mississippi.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they were journeying along, one of the men, with blistered feet,\\r\\nstopped to adjust his shoes. When he resumed his march, he found that\\r\\nthe party was out of sight, and he could not overtake them. The grass\\r\\nof the prairie was higher than the men\\'s heads, and there were many\\r\\ntracks through it which were called buffalo streets. It was impossible\\r\\nfor him to tell which path the men had taken. He was hopelessly lost.\\r\\nTo follow either one of them might lead him farther and farther from\\r\\nhis companions, where he would perish miserably.\\r\\n\\r\\nNight came. He fired his gun several times, but could get no response.\\r\\nHe threw himself upon the grass. In the intensity of his anxiety, he\\r\\ncould not sleep. All the next day and the next night, he remained upon\\r\\nthe spot, hoping that his companions might come back in search for him.\\r\\nThey did not return. He had been reprimanded the preceding day for some\\r\\nmisconduct, and it was supposed that he had deserted.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost in despair he retraced his steps, travelling mostly by night,\\r\\nthrough fear that he might encounter the savages. After a month of toil\\r\\nand suffering, ragged and emaciate he at midnight reached the\\r\\nsettlement. Many weeks passed away, and no tidings whatever were heard\\r\\nof the exploring party. One morning early in March, M. Joutel chanced\\r\\nto be upon the roof of a hut, when he saw far away on the prairie,\\r\\neight men approaching. He immediately took a well-armed party and\\r\\nadvanced to meet them. They proved to be a portion of the exploring\\r\\nband. They said that others were returning by another route. They were\\r\\nall in a deplorable condition. Their clothes were in tatters. Most of\\r\\nthem were without hats. Their shirts were entirely worn out.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll were rejoiced to see La Salle again. But he had no tidings to give\\r\\nof the long-sought-for river. The situation in which the colonists,\\r\\nwith their greatly diminished numbers, now found themselves was\\r\\nappalling. They were utterly lost in the boundless wilderness of this\\r\\nnew world. All communication with their friends in France was cut off.\\r\\nThere was no hope that any French vessel would ever search for them; or\\r\\ncould find them, even if such search were undertaken. The Indians were\\r\\nhostile. Death would gradually diminish their numbers, and finally the\\r\\nremnant would either be exterminated or carried into captivity by the\\r\\nsavages.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo add to the affliction of La Salle, the Belle, the only vessel\\r\\nremaining to him, was wrecked and utterly lost. Several of the sailors\\r\\nwere drowned; and stores of inestimable value were destroyed. Father Le\\r\\nClercq, in describing this untoward event, writes:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"We leave the reader to imagine the grief and the affliction felt\\r\\n    by the Chevalier La Salle, at an accident which completely ruined\\r\\n    all his measures. His great courage even could not have borne him\\r\\n    up, had not God aided his virtue by the help of extraordinary\\r\\n    grace.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil the loss of the Belle, he had been sustained by the hope that, in\\r\\nthe last extremity, the remnant of his company might find their way\\r\\nback to St. Domingo, and thence to France. This hope was now\\r\\nextinguished.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder these circumstances La Salle resolved to undertake another\\r\\nexploring tour. Having refreshed himself and his men, and obtained new\\r\\narticles of clothing, mainly by distributing the garments of the dead\\r\\namong the living, early in May, 1686, the party again set forth. Those\\r\\nwho remained behind employed themselves in strengthening the\\r\\nfortifications; in unsuccessfully cultivating the soil, for most of the\\r\\nseeds would not sprout, and in the chase, laying in a store of jerked\\r\\nmeat. They had several hostile rencontres with the Indians, in which\\r\\nthe savages were invariably beaten, in consequence of the superiority\\r\\nof the weapons of the Europeans.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there was no harmony in the settlement. Loud murmurs ascended\\r\\ncontinually. Some denounced La Salle. Some defended him. The\\r\\nantagonistic parties were almost ready to draw their swords against\\r\\neach other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XV.\\r\\n\\r\\n_A Trip toward Mexico._\\r\\n\\r\\nArrangements for the Journey.

Hardihood\\r\\nof the Indian Hunter. The Long Sickness. A Man Devoured by a Crocodile.\\r\\nThe Return.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThough La Salle was now more than four hundred miles west of the\\r\\nMississippi River, he was still under the impression that he was east\\r\\nof that point. He therefore, in his blind search, directed his steps\\r\\ntoward the setting sun. Father Douay, who accompanied this expedition,\\r\\nhas given a detailed account of its adventures.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter religious ceremonies in the chapel of the fort, the party,\\r\\nconsisting of twenty persons, set out, on the 22d of April, 1686. They\\r\\ntook, for the journey, four pounds of powder, four pounds of lead, two\\r\\naxes, two dozen knives, two kettles, and a few awls and beads.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the third day out they entered one of the most beautiful prairies\\r\\nthey had ever seen. To their astonishment they saw, on the plain, a\\r\\nlarge number of people, some on foot and some on horseback. Several of\\r\\nthese came galloping toward them, booted and spurred, and seated on\\r\\nsaddles. They were Indians who were in a high state of civilization,\\r\\nhaving long held intimate relations with the Spaniards. They gave the\\r\\nFrenchmen an earnest invitation to visit them, in their village, which\\r\\nwas about twenty miles distant. But as this would take them quite out\\r\\nof their course, the invitation was declined. Continuing their tour,\\r\\nthey encamped at night, being careful to throw up around them\\r\\nentrenchments which would protect them from attack. The next two days\\r\\nthey continued their journey over the prairie, until they reached a\\r\\nriver, which La Salle named Robek. The amount of wild cattle seen was\\r\\nprodigious. Many of the herds numbered thousands. In a few moments they\\r\\nshot ten. The meat they cut into very thin slices, and dried in the\\r\\nblazing sun, over the smoke of a smouldering fire. Thus they were\\r\\nprovided with nutritious food for four or five days.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrossing the Robek in a hastily constructed raft, after marching about\\r\\nfive miles they came to another very beautiful river, wider and deeper\\r\\nthan the Seine at Paris. It was skirted by a magnificent forest, with\\r\\nno underbrush, presenting a park such as the hand of man never planted.\\r\\nIn this Eden-like grove there were many trees laden with rich fruit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis river, which La Salle named La Maligne, they also crossed upon a\\r\\nraft. Passing through the forest beyond, they entered upon another\\r\\nextensive prairie. Continuing their tour through a country which they\\r\\ndescribe as full of enchantments, with blooming plains skirted with\\r\\nvines, fruit trees, and groves, they came to a river which they called\\r\\nHiens, from one of their party, a German, who, in endeavoring to ford\\r\\nit, got stuck fast in the mud. Two men swam across with axes on their\\r\\nbacks. They then cut down the largest trees, on each side, so that\\r\\ntheir branches met in the middle. By this bridge the party crossed.\\r\\nMore than thirty times, during this trip, they resorted to this measure\\r\\nfor crossing streams.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After several days\\' march,\" writes Father Douay, \"in a pretty fine\\r\\ncountry, we entered a delightful territory, where we found a numerous\\r\\ntribe, who received us with all possible friendship; even the women\\r\\ncoming to embrace our men. They made us sit down on well-made mats, at\\r\\nthe upper end of the wigwam, near the chiefs, who presented us with the\\r\\ncalumet, adorned with feathers of every hue, which we had to smoke in\\r\\nturn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indians feasted them abundantly, with the best of their fare, and\\r\\npresented them with some excellently tanned buffalo skins, for\\r\\nmoccasins. La Salle gave them, in return, some beads, with which they\\r\\nseemed to be greatly delighted. Father Douay writes:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"During our stay, Chevalier La Salle so won them by his manners,\\r\\n    and insinuated so much of the glory of our king, telling them that\\r\\n    he was greater and higher than the sun, that they were all ravished\\r\\n    with astonishment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nContinuing their journey, they crossed several rivers, until they came\\r\\nto a large Indian village of three hundred cabins. Just as they were\\r\\napproaching the village they came upon a herd of deer and shot one. The\\r\\nIndians, who heard the report and saw the deer fall dead, were\\r\\nterror-stricken. In a mass they fled to the neighboring forest. La\\r\\nSalle, to avoid surprise, entered the village in military array.\\r\\n\\r\\nEntering the largest cabin, which proved to be that of the chief, they\\r\\nfound a very aged woman, the wife of the chief, who, from her\\r\\ninfirmities, was unable to fly. La Salle treated the terrified woman\\r\\nwith the greatest kindness, and by signs assured her that he intended\\r\\nno harm. Three grown-up sons of the chief, who were watching the\\r\\nprogress of events with great solicitude, seeing no indication of\\r\\nhostile measures, cautiously returned. La Salle met there with friendly\\r\\nsigns, and accepted the presented calumet. The young chiefs then called\\r\\nto their people in the distance, and all returned. The evening was\\r\\npassed in feasting, dancing, and all kinds of semi-barbarian\\r\\nfestivities.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill La Salle did not venture to sleep in the wigwams, where his party\\r\\nwould be entirely in the power of those who might prove treacherous. He\\r\\nreturned to encamp in a dense cane-brake, where no foe could approach\\r\\nwithout giving warning. In the night, some thought they heard\\r\\napproaching footsteps. But La Salle made it manifest that they were all\\r\\non the alert, and the foe, if there were any foe approaching, drew off.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe alarm was doubtless groundless. The next morning there was a\\r\\nrepetition of all the tokens of friendship which were manifested the\\r\\nevening before. Continuing their route about thirty miles, they came to\\r\\nanother Indian village. The savages seemed to have no suspicions\\r\\nwhatever of the strangers. A party, seeing them approaching in the\\r\\ndistance, came out to meet them as if they were old friends. They\\r\\nseemed to be quite gentlemanly men in their courteous and polished\\r\\ndemeanor. They gave the strangers an earnest invitation to visit their\\r\\nvillage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese Indians had heard of the Spaniards, and of the atrocities of\\r\\nwhich they were guilty farther west. They were quite overjoyed when\\r\\ntold that the French were at war with the Spaniards; and were quite\\r\\neager to raise an army and march with the French to attack them. La\\r\\nSalle entered into a cordial alliance with these Indians, who were\\r\\ncalled the Kironas. He promised that he would eventually, if it were in\\r\\nhis power, return with more numerous troops.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would appear that La Salle was now convinced that he would not find\\r\\nthe Mississippi by journeying further west; for he turned his steps\\r\\ntoward the northeast. There was a large river near the village, across\\r\\nwhich the hospitable Indians paddled them in their boats. As they were\\r\\ncrossing a beautiful prairie, their Indian companion, whose name was\\r\\nNika, called out suddenly, \"I am dead! I am dead.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA venomous snake had bitten him, and the limb began instantly to throb\\r\\nand swell. In rude surgery, they, with their pocket-knives, cut out the\\r\\nflesh around. Deep gashes were cut near the wound hoping that the\\r\\npoison would be carried away in the free flowing of the blood. They\\r\\napplied poultices of herbs, which they had been told were available in\\r\\nsuch cases. After much suffering, which the Indian bore with wonderful\\r\\nstoicism, he recovered from the perilous wound.\\r\\n\\r\\nJourneying on, day after day, they at length reached a broad river,\\r\\nwhose current was so rapid that they saw, at once, that it would be\\r\\nvery difficult to effect a passage. This was probably the Colorado,\\r\\nmany miles above the point where they had touched it in one of their\\r\\nprevious excursions. They made a raft. Most of the company were afraid\\r\\nto attempt to cross upon it. La Salle, with his brother Cavalier and\\r\\none or two others, got on. As soon as they pushed out from the shore,\\r\\ninto the middle of the stream, the swiftly rushing torrent seized them,\\r\\nwhirled the raft around, and swept it down the stream with resistless\\r\\nvelocity. In a few moments it disappeared, as the foaming flood bore it\\r\\naround a bend in the stream.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was a moment,\" writes Father Douay, \"of extreme anguish for us all.\\r\\nWe despaired of ever again seeing our guardian angel the Chevalier de\\r\\nla Salle.\" Several hours passed away. The men left upon the bank were\\r\\nin utter bewilderment. They knew not what to do. \"The day was spent,\"\\r\\nit is written, \"in tears and weeping.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJust before nightfall, to their great joy, they saw La Salle and his\\r\\nparty on the opposite side of the river. It subsequently appeared that\\r\\nthe raft struck a large tree, which had been torn from the banks, and\\r\\nwas almost stationary in the middle of the stream; its roots, heavy\\r\\nwith earth and stone, dragging on the bottom. By seizing the branches\\r\\nthey dragged themselves out of the current, and by grasping the\\r\\nbranches of other trees, overhanging the water, they at length, through\\r\\na thousand perils, succeeded in gaining the eastern bank, several miles\\r\\nbelow the point where they had constructed the raft. One of the men was\\r\\nswept from the raft and swam ashore.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe party was now divided, with the foaming and apparently impassable\\r\\ntorrent rushing between them. On both sides the night was spent in\\r\\ngreat anxiety. Many were the plans suggested and abandoned, to form a\\r\\nreunion. In the morning, La Salle shouted to them across the river,\\r\\nthat they must build two light rafts, of the very buoyant canes, and\\r\\ncross on them, promising them that he would send several strong\\r\\nswimmers into the river to aid them.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne such raft was constructed. With fear and trembling five men\\r\\nventured upon it. The raft was so light that it barely supported its\\r\\nburden. With long poles they succeeded in reaching the centre of the\\r\\nstream. Then two men from the opposite side swam out, and by their aid,\\r\\nwith vigorous paddling, they safely reached the land, after drifting\\r\\nfar down the stream.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most timid ones were left behind. They dared not venture the\\r\\npassage. La Salle, seeing their hesitation, ordered his men to pack up\\r\\nand continue their march, leaving them behind. The greater peril\\r\\novercame the less. To be abandoned there they deemed sure destruction.\\r\\nThey shouted across the river, begging for delay. Inspired by the\\r\\nenergies of almost despair, they vigorously built their raft, and by\\r\\nnoon all were happily reassembled to press on their way.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor two days they moved slowly and laboriously along, cutting their\\r\\nway, with the two axes, through an immense forest of cane-brakes. On\\r\\nthe third day an incident occurred which peculiarly illustrates the\\r\\nsagacity and endurance of the Indians. Their Indian hunter, Nika, who,\\r\\nas we have said, accompanied La Salle from Canada, left the party the\\r\\nday before they reached the river, in search of game. They had heard\\r\\nnothing from him since. It was in vain to search for him, and the party\\r\\ncould not delay its march to wait for his return.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the evening of the fourth day after his absence, as the men were\\r\\ngathered around the camp fire, little expecting to see Nika again, he\\r\\ncame quietly into the camp as composed as if nothing unusual had\\r\\noccurred. He had on his shoulders a large amount of the choicest cuts\\r\\nof venison, which he had dried in the sun, and nearly the whole of a\\r\\ndeer which he had just killed. He had probably swum the stream,\\r\\nfloating the venison across on a log by his side. And all this he had\\r\\ndone, notwithstanding his wound from the bite of a snake and all the\\r\\ncruel surgery he had undergone. La Salle was so overjoyed to see again\\r\\nhis faithful attendant and friend, that he ordered several guns to be\\r\\nfired in salute of his safe return.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Still marching east,\" writes Father Douay, \"we entered countries more\\r\\nbeautiful than any we yet had passed. Here we found native tribes who\\r\\nhad nothing barbarous about them but the name. Among others we met a\\r\\nvery honest Indian returning from the chase with his wife and family.\\r\\nHe presented Chevalier de la Salle with one of his horses, and some\\r\\nmeat. He also invited all our party to his cabin. To induce us to visit\\r\\nhim, he left his wife, children, and game with us as pledges, and\\r\\ngalloped off to his village to announce our coming and to secure for us\\r\\na cordial welcome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNika, and another of the attendants of La Salle, accompanied him. The\\r\\nvillage was at some distance, so that two days passed before their\\r\\nreturn. The hospitable Indian came back with two horses laden with\\r\\nprovisions. Several chiefs and warriors came back with him on\\r\\nhorseback. They were all neatly and even beautifully dressed, in softly\\r\\ntanned deer-skins, tastefully fringed, and with head-dresses of waving\\r\\nplumes. In picturesque beauty their attire would favorably compare with\\r\\nthe court dresses of most of the European monarchies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe principal chief rode forward, bearing conspicuously the plumed\\r\\ncalumet of peace. La Salle had been slowly advancing, and the two\\r\\nparties met about nine miles from the village. After cordial greetings,\\r\\nthe united band continued its march. When but a short distance from the\\r\\ncluster of native dwellings, an immense concourse of people was seen\\r\\nflocking out to meet the strangers. The young men were quite imposingly\\r\\nmarshalled in military array. But the reception was so cordial, and the\\r\\nindications of sincerity so unquestionable, that no one entertained the\\r\\nslightest apprehension of treachery.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle and his party remained three days, enjoying the good cheer of\\r\\nthis truly hospitable people. This very prudent commander encamped\\r\\nthree or four miles outside of the village. He had no fear of the\\r\\nnatives, but he had not full confidence in his own men. Any impropriety\\r\\nof the members of his party toward the females of the village, might\\r\\nsuddenly turn their friendly relations into bitter hostility. There\\r\\nwere apparently many pleasant families. The young maidens were\\r\\ngenerally of pleasing features, and graceful as sylphs in form. La\\r\\nSalle purchased several horses, which proved to be of inestimable value\\r\\nto him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe region which the explorers had reached was probably not far from\\r\\nAustin County, in the present State of Texas. It was a more highly\\r\\ncivilized and more densely inhabited country than any they had hitherto\\r\\npassed through, in any portion of the continent. For a distance of\\r\\nsixty miles they found a continuous series of villages, but a few miles\\r\\napart, all prosperous, harmonious, and happy.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir cabins were large and commodious, frequently forty or fifty feet\\r\\nhigh, with dome-like roofs, in the shape of the old-fashioned\\r\\nbee-hives. They were made by planting very tall saplings in the ground,\\r\\nin the form of a circle. Their tops were bent down and bound together.\\r\\nThis whole framework was very neatly and effectually thatched with the\\r\\nlong grass of the prairie. The beds, consisting of soft mats, were\\r\\nranged around the cabin, raised about three feet from the ground. The\\r\\nfire, seldom needed except for cooking, in that warm latitude, was in\\r\\nthe middle. Each cabin usually accommodated two families.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese Indians were called the Coenis nation. It was very evident that\\r\\nthey had held some intercourse with the Spaniards. La Salle found among\\r\\nthem silver coins, silver spoons, and various kinds of European\\r\\nclothes. Horses were abundant. A horse was readily exchanged for an\\r\\naxe. La Salle could only converse with them by signs. They said no\\r\\nSpaniards had ever yet visited them, though there was a settlement of\\r\\nthem at the distance of about six days\\' journey west. Several of their\\r\\nmost intelligent men drew a map of the country upon some bark. They\\r\\ndelineated a large river many days journey to the east, which La Salle\\r\\nhad no doubt was the Mississippi.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Chevalier La Salle,\" writes Father Douay, \"who perfectly\\r\\nunderstood the art of gaining the Indians of all nations, filled these\\r\\nwith admiration at every moment. He told them that the chief of the\\r\\nFrench was the greatest chief in the world; that he was as far above\\r\\nthe Spaniards as the sun is above the earth. On his recounting the\\r\\nvictories of our monarch they burst into exclamations of astonishment.\\r\\nI found them very docile and tractable. They comprehended well enough\\r\\nwhat we told them of the truth of a God.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the refreshment of this delightful visit, the explorers continued\\r\\ntheir journey. After travelling about thirty miles, four of the men,\\r\\nduring a night\\'s encampment, deserted and went back to cast in their\\r\\nlot for life with the Indians. They were houseless and homeless\\r\\nadventurers, with no ties to bind them to the cares, toils, and\\r\\nrestraints of civilized life. It is not surprising that they should\\r\\nhave been charmed with the ease, abundance, and freedom of life in the\\r\\nwigwam. They probably became incorporated in the tribes, took Indian\\r\\nwives, and were heard of no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this encampment La Salle and his nephew, M. Moranget, were both\\r\\nattacked with a violent fever. They had frequent relapses, so that two\\r\\nweary months passed before the march could be resumed. During this long\\r\\ndelay they did not suffer for food, for there was abundance of game,\\r\\nand of great variety. Their powder, however, began to fail them.\\r\\nAccording to their estimate, they were about four hundred and fifty\\r\\nmiles, in a straight line, from their settlement. It was resolved now\\r\\nto hasten back. Their horses, which found abundant pasturage on the\\r\\nrich prairies, did them good service, bearing the sick upon their backs\\r\\nand the burdens of all.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey came to a river which it was necessary to cross by a raft. Indeed\\r\\nevery few leagues they encountered such a stream. They generally swam\\r\\ntheir horses over. In this case, La Salle, with one or two of his men,\\r\\nwas upon a light raft of canes. Suddenly an enormous crocodile, twenty\\r\\nfeet in length, raised his head out of the water, and with one snap of\\r\\nhis horrid jaws grasped one of the men by the waist and drew him under.\\r\\nAs the monster sank, there was one short, wild shriek from the victim,\\r\\na slight crimson tinge of the waves, and a small circling whirlpool\\r\\nmarking the spot where the huge beast had gone down. Thus, in an\\r\\ninstant, as by the lightning\\'s flash, another of the terrible tragedies\\r\\nof this tragic world had come and gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 17th of October this wearied and diminished party reached the\\r\\ncamp, after an absence of six months. Of the twenty who left, but eight\\r\\nreturned. The meeting was one of joy and of sadness. Both parties had\\r\\nnarratives to give of disaster; and gloom impenetrable still hung over\\r\\nthe feeble colony, so rapidly wasting away. In commenting upon this\\r\\nenterprise, Father Douay writes:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"It would be difficult to find in history, courage more intrepid or\\r\\n    more invincible than that of the Chevalier de la Salle. In\\r\\n    adversity he was never cast down. He always hoped, with the help of\\r\\n    heaven, to succeed in his enterprises, despite all the obstacles\\r\\n    that rose against it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVI.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The Last Days of La Salle._\\r\\n\\r\\nPlan for the New Journey. Magnitude of the Enterprise. Affecting\\r\\nLeave-taking. The Journey Commenced. Adventures by the Way. Friendly\\r\\nCharacter of the Indians. Vast Realms of Fertility and Beauty. The Joys\\r\\nand the Sorrows of such a Pilgrimage. The Assassination of La Salle and\\r\\nof three of his Companions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle was now fully convinced that he was west of the Mississippi\\r\\nRiver. He resolved to set out on a journey across the country to\\r\\nCanada, a distance of probably not less than two thousand miles. His\\r\\ndesign was to send tidings to France of his disasters, and thus to\\r\\nsecure aid to be sent thence to his suffering and expiring colony.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy pursuing his route toward the northeast, he was sure of eventually\\r\\nstriking the Mississippi. He would then feel quite at home. Following\\r\\nup that stream and the Illinois, he could easily pass over to the\\r\\nlakes, and then reach Canada through regions with which he was quite\\r\\nfamiliar. More than two months were spent in strengthening the defences\\r\\nof the settlement, and in laying in stores of provisions for those who\\r\\nwere to be left behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt midnight of the 7th of January, 1687, the whole company met in the\\r\\nlittle chapel for a solemn religious service, to implore God\\'s blessing\\r\\nupon the enterprise. The scene was very affecting. Nearly all were in\\r\\ntears. There were but few chances that those then bidding each other\\r\\nadieu would ever meet again. Those who left, and those who remained,\\r\\nwere alike exposed. La Salle selected twenty men to accompany him.\\r\\nAmong those, were his brother, his ever-faithful Indian attendant, M.\\r\\nDouay, to whose pen we are indebted for the record of the last\\r\\nexpedition, and M. Joutel, who kept a daily journal of the events of\\r\\nthis journey. M. Douay wrote also quite a minute account of the\\r\\nexpedition. Both of their narratives now lie before me. We have no\\r\\nreason to doubt the accuracy of either. There were but twenty French\\r\\nleft behind, including seven women and children. La Salle gave them a\\r\\nparting address. Father Douay writes:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"He made an address full of eloquence, with that engaging way so\\r\\n    natural to him. The whole colony was present, and were all moved to\\r\\n    tears. They were alike persuaded of the necessity of his voyage and\\r\\n    the uprightness of his intentions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe property left with the colonists consisted of seventy pigs, large\\r\\nand small, twenty hens and chickens, a few barrels of corn, which was\\r\\ncarefully kept for the sick, a considerable quantity of powder and\\r\\nlead, and eight cannons, but without balls.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe heroic and devout Father MembrÃ© remained as the spiritual guide. M.\\r\\nBarbier was left with the secular command. La Salle drew up very minute\\r\\ndirections for the administration of affairs during his absence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We parted,\" writes M. Joutel, \"in a manner so tender, so sorrowful,\\r\\nthat it would seem that we had a secret presentiment that we should\\r\\nnever again see each other. Father MembrÃ© was deeply affected. He said\\r\\nto me that never before had he experienced a parting so painful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the 12th of January, 1689, when this truly forlorn hope set out\\r\\nupon its long journey. They took with them the five horses, bearing\\r\\nsome articles of food and such things as they would need for their\\r\\nnight\\'s encampment. The second day of their journey they came to a\\r\\nplain about six miles wide, which seemed to be covered with buffaloes,\\r\\ndeer, flocks of wild turkeys, and every variety of game. Beyond the\\r\\nplain there was a splendid growth of trees. Upon entering the grove,\\r\\nthey found that it fringed a small river. Concealed by these trees,\\r\\nthey succeeded in shooting five buffaloes which had come to the river\\r\\nto drink. They crossed the river on a raft, and camped a mile and a\\r\\nhalf beyond, in a drenching rain. The skins and meat of these animals\\r\\nwere packed upon the horses. The skins, easily tanned, were of immense\\r\\nvalue in their subsequent lodgings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning, the 14th, the sun rose in a cloudless sky. The\\r\\nprairie seemed spread out for leagues before them, covered with herds\\r\\nof buffaloes and deer, while immense flocks of turkeys and other birds\\r\\nof the prairie rose before them. About noon they saw, in the distance,\\r\\nan immense herd of buffaloes rushing over the plains as if mad. They\\r\\nconjectured at once that some Indian hunters were pursuing them. Their\\r\\nconjecture proved correct.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon they saw a savage, on the full run, and very flat-footed, pursuing\\r\\nthe herd. Hastily the load was thrown from one of the horses, a man was\\r\\nmounted upon him, and galloping over the plain soon overtook the\\r\\nIndian, and led him back to the company. When the poor man saw himself\\r\\nsurrounded by a group of white men, such as he had seen before, he was\\r\\ngreatly terrified. And he had cause to be frightened. La Salle\\'s\\r\\nassociates infamously urged that he should be put to death, in revenge\\r\\nfor the murder of their companions by some unknown Indian band. The\\r\\nhumane, magnanimous leader found it necessary to present to his\\r\\nreckless followers such motives as they could appreciate. He said to\\r\\nthem:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are but few in number. We have before us a journey of hundreds of\\r\\nmiles through a region crowded with Indian tribes. If we rouse the\\r\\nvengeance of the savages, we shall all be cut off. Let us treat them\\r\\nwith kindness, and thus we shall secure for ourselves kind treatment in\\r\\nreturn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cordial smiles and friendly signs of this truly good man soon\\r\\ndispelled apparently the great alarm of the stranger. A fire was built.\\r\\nAfter abundantly feeding their hungry guest, and smoking with him the\\r\\nfriendly pipe, La Salle, assuring him of his desire to do harm to none,\\r\\nbut good to all, dismissed him with presents which to the savage must\\r\\nhave seemed almost like celestial gifts. Still the cautious Indian,\\r\\naccustomed to treachery, was evidently uncertain as to the fate which\\r\\nawaited him. As he withdrew, he cast anxious glances around, until he\\r\\nhad attained the distance of a few rods, when he took to flight, with\\r\\nalmost the rapidity of a deer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe travellers continued their route, and after an hour or two,\\r\\novertook another Indian hunter. They caught him, and lavished upon him\\r\\nthe same acts of kindness. As evening was approaching, they saw a large\\r\\nband of savages in the distance. Their attitude was somewhat menacing.\\r\\nWhen they caught sight of the little cluster of strangers, they\\r\\nseparated into two parties, and advanced on the right and left, as if\\r\\nto surround them. When the two bands had come within musket-shot, La\\r\\nSalle ordered a halt. The savages halted also. For a few moments they\\r\\nattentively regarded each other, no movement being made on either side.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen La Salle, laying aside his arms, walked slowly forward toward the\\r\\nparty where the head chief seemed to be, making signs for the chief to\\r\\ncome and meet him. The chief was a tall man of powerful frame, and\\r\\nrichly decorated. He came cautiously forward, while the rest of his\\r\\nparty followed slowly at a little distance behind. As soon as it was\\r\\nseen that the two chiefs met cordially, all came running together in\\r\\nthe interchange of caresses and every mark of friendly greeting.\\r\\n\\r\\nFires were built, food was cooked, pipes were smoked. There was\\r\\nfeasting and dancing and shouting. It was a marvellous spectacle which\\r\\nwas then and there presented of semi-civilized and full barbarian\\r\\njollification.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe savages were evidently delighted with their reception. They\\r\\nexamined their presents with astonishment. With unfeigned joy they\\r\\nlearned that La Salle intended to return and settle in their country;\\r\\nand that he would bring an abundance of his treasures, which he would\\r\\nexchange with them for such articles as they had to part with. It was\\r\\nnow the hour of evening twilight. The two parties separated, each going\\r\\nits own way. About a mile and a half in advance, there was a beautiful\\r\\ngrove and a running stream. La Salle encamped there. With his customary\\r\\nprudence he threw up intrenchments, and established sentinels as if he\\r\\nwere in the enemy\\'s country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had but just established their camp, when they saw six savages\\r\\napproaching, following each other in single file. They came forward\\r\\nwithout any hesitation, as if visiting old friends. By signs they said\\r\\nthat they had heard of the kind treatment their fellow countrymen had\\r\\nmet with, and that they were brothers, not enemies. After a short and\\r\\npleasant visit they retired, and the camp was left to undisturbed\\r\\nrepose.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning, at an early hour, the march was resumed. There was\\r\\nbefore them a stream too deep to be forded. Not wishing to lose time in\\r\\nconstructing a raft, they followed up the west bank of the stream for\\r\\nseveral miles. Their route led through an enchanting region of\\r\\nlawn-like prairies and park-like groves. The river was fringed with\\r\\ntrees of every variety, without any underbrush. There were many pretty\\r\\nlittle creeks to be crossed, which ran into the main stream. The water\\r\\nwas pure, sweet, and clear as crystal. Occasionally they came to a\\r\\ncane-brake, through which they cut their way with axes. Their appetites\\r\\nwere fed with abundance of game.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day, the 19th, they made but a short journey, and experienced\\r\\ngreat fatigue in fording streams and cutting their way through\\r\\ncane-brakes. They came across a few deserted cabins of the Indians.\\r\\nDuring the slow progress of the day, their skilful Indian hunter Nika\\r\\nkilled eight buffaloes. The most tender cuts were taken from them, and\\r\\nthey there crossed the river by a ford.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter traversing a few leagues, they came to another river, flowing\\r\\nthrough a low plain, elevated but slightly above the stream. A dense\\r\\nfog set in, accompanied by a deluging rain. Here they encamped in the\\r\\nwoods which bordered the river. They passed a comfortless night, and\\r\\nthe storm detained them all the next day.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 19th the rain ceased, but the fog continued. Their path led\\r\\nthrough marshy ground thoroughly soaked with rain, so that they often\\r\\nsank to their knees in the mire. Their feet were shod with moccasins\\r\\nmade of the hide of buffaloes. These being alternately wet and dried,\\r\\nbecame stiff, and blistered their feet cruelly. Fortunately, they\\r\\nstruck upon one of the \"streets\" made by the buffaloes, as in thousands\\r\\nthey followed one after the other, crushing their way through the\\r\\ncane-brakes. These animals were, by instinct, good engineers, and\\r\\ninvariably selected the most favorable routes. Still the voyagers were\\r\\noften compelled to wade through deep mire, and their sufferings were at\\r\\ntimes severe.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the night of the 19th, they fortunately came upon a ridge, where\\r\\nthey could enjoy a dry encampment. They built a roaring fire, cooked a\\r\\nsavory supper, nursed their blistered feet, and during a few hours of\\r\\nrefreshing sleep forgot their toils. As they awoke the next morning the\\r\\nriver was again falling. Still they pressed on, entering upon another\\r\\nvast prairie covered with herds of buffaloes. At night they encamped\\r\\nupon the banks of a river too deep to be forded. On the 21st they\\r\\nascended the banks of the stream, hoping to find a shallow spot where\\r\\nthey could cross. Instead of this, they came to a place where the river\\r\\nflowed through a narrow and deep channel, with large trees on each\\r\\nside. They cut down two of these trees, so that their branches met in\\r\\nthe middle, crossed on this bridge, and swam their horses over.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other side, a beautiful country, of elevated, undulating\\r\\nprairie, opened before them. As they were preparing to encamp in the\\r\\nshelter of a grove, they heard voices, and soon beheld fifteen Indians\\r\\napproaching. The savages manifested no alarm, but in token of peace\\r\\nlaid aside their bows and arrows, and came into the camp. They ate,\\r\\nsmoked, exchanged presents, and went on their way rejoicing, promising\\r\\nto visit the camp again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe horses, as well as the men, were quite exhausted. They therefore\\r\\nremained, for a day of rest, on their very pleasant camping ground.\\r\\nDuring the day a band of twenty-two Indians came to them. They had\\r\\nshields impervious to arrows, made of the hide of buffaloes. They were\\r\\nat war with another tribe. They said that there were other white men,\\r\\nat the distance of ten days\\' journey on the west, doubtless referring\\r\\nto the Spaniards. The interview was mutually pleasant, and La Salle\\r\\nobtained some important information in reference to the continuance of\\r\\nhis route.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnward they pressed, day after day, with alternate sunshine and storm,\\r\\nthrough marsh and forest, over prairies and across rivers, without\\r\\nencountering any adventure of much importance until the 1st of\\r\\nFebruary. That day they discovered, at a distance, an Indian village.\\r\\nLa Salle, leaving M. Joutel in charge of the camp, took his brother and\\r\\nseven men, and set out to reconnoitre. They came to a village of\\r\\ntwenty-five wigwams, very pleasantly situated. Each wigwam contained\\r\\nfour or five men, besides quite a number of women and children. The\\r\\nIndians received their guests very hospitably, conducted them to the\\r\\ndwelling of their chief, and seated them upon mats of buffalo skins. A\\r\\ngreat crowd gathered within and around the cabin. The chief, after\\r\\nfeeding them abundantly upon buffalo steaks, informed them that he had\\r\\nbeen expecting their arrival. Other Indians had told him that they were\\r\\nin the country, and that they were on a route which would lead them\\r\\nnear his village.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerfect harmony prevailed. Presents were exchanged. The Indians were\\r\\neager to give a nicely tanned buffalo robe for a knife or almost any\\r\\ntrinket in the hands of the white men. But La Salle had no means of\\r\\ntransporting the robes, which would prove so valuable in European\\r\\nmarkets. They continued their journey, often meeting with Indians, who\\r\\nwere always friendly. At times a brotherly band would accompany them\\r\\nduring the march of a whole day. By the aid of the Indians, the very\\r\\nlight frame of a canoe was constructed, which was easily packed and\\r\\ncarried. By stretching over it the skin of a buffalo, from which the\\r\\nhair had been removed, they were furnished with a very buoyant boat,\\r\\nwith which to cross the rivers. The horses could easily swim the\\r\\nstreams.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 10th of February, they saw before them a vast plain which had\\r\\nbeen swept by the flames. Thinking that they might not find game there,\\r\\nthey made a halt of two days, to lay in a store of jerked meat.\\r\\nResuming their journey, they soon passed the scathed region and entered\\r\\nagain upon a country of bloom and verdure. On the evening of the 15th,\\r\\nthey camped on the borders of a stream, where they saw evidences that a\\r\\nband of savages had recently passed that way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning La Salle took his brother and seven men, and followed\\r\\na well-trodden Indian trail in search of a village. After a short walk,\\r\\nthey came upon a cluster of fifty or sixty cabins. His reception was,\\r\\nas usual, cordial in the extreme. The leading men of the village were\\r\\ncourteous in their bearing and intelligent in reference to matters\\r\\nrelating to their own country. They gave the names of twenty tribes or\\r\\nnations, through whose territories La Salle had already passed from his\\r\\nsettlement, which he called St. Louis. On the 17th, one of the horses\\r\\nfell, and sprained his shoulder, so that he had to be left behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor several days the journey was somewhat monotonous. They made about\\r\\ntwenty or twenty-five miles a day. Indian hunters were continually met\\r\\nwith, and Indian villages entered with essentially the same rites of\\r\\nfriendship and hospitality. From some of these Indians they heard\\r\\ntidings of those Frenchmen who had deserted. They were living in a very\\r\\nfriendly manner among the Indians. On the 1st of March they came to an\\r\\nimmense marsh, partially submerged in water. The intricate passage\\r\\nacross it was very difficult to find, and required the services of a\\r\\nguide. Several of the Indians volunteered, and with great tenderness\\r\\nled them safely across.\\r\\n\\r\\nPassing the morass caused a delay of four or five days, as it could not\\r\\nbe undertaken in a drenching rain which chanced then to be falling. On\\r\\nthe 15th they emerged from this gloomy region and entered a country\\r\\nwhich, from the contrast, appeared to them remarkably beautiful. Here\\r\\nthey encamped for a brief rest. Nika brought in word that he had killed\\r\\ntwo buffaloes, and wished to have a couple of horses sent to bring in\\r\\nthe meat. A party of five was sent out, led by M. Moranget, who was a\\r\\nrash and irritable man. There were three men who had accompanied the\\r\\nhunter, and who were cutting up and drying the meat, in preparation for\\r\\ntransporting it to the camp. At the same time they were cooking for\\r\\nthemselves some of the choicest pieces.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Moranget reached the place and found the men feasting, as he\\r\\nthought, rather than jerking the meat, he reprimanded them, in his\\r\\naccustomed tones of severity. The men chanced to be the very worst and\\r\\nmost desperate in the camp. Moranget accompanied his denunciations with\\r\\nstill more irritating actions. He took from them the delicious morsels\\r\\nwhich they cooked. Four men, for another had joined them, greatly\\r\\nenraged, sullenly abandoned their work, and retiring a short distance\\r\\nagreed to avenge themselves by killing Moranget, and also by killing\\r\\nNika and another man who was the valet of La Salle. Both of these men\\r\\nwere friends and supporters of Moranget.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey waited till night. All took their supper together. It was the\\r\\nnight of the 17th of March. Though in that genial climate the weather\\r\\nwas serene and mild, a rousing fire was found very grateful in\\r\\nprotecting them from the chill of the night air. With the fading\\r\\ntwilight the stars shone down brightly upon them, and, surrounded by\\r\\nthe silence and solemnity of the prairie and the forest, they were soon\\r\\napparently all asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the murderers, Liotot, cautiously arose as by agreement, and\\r\\nwith a hatchet in his hand, creeping toward Moranget, with one\\r\\ndesperate blow split open his skull from crown to chin. The deed was\\r\\neffectually done. And yet with sinewy arm blow followed blow, till the\\r\\nhead was one mass of clotted gore. The other two were despatched in the\\r\\nsame way. The three remaining conspirators stood, with their guns\\r\\ncocked and primed, to shoot down either of the victims who might\\r\\nsucceed in making any resistance. There is some slight discrepancy in\\r\\nthe detail of these murders. It is said that Moranget, upon receiving\\r\\nthe first blow, made a convulsive movement, as if to rise; but that the\\r\\nvalet and the Indian did not stir.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne crime always leads to another. The conspirators, having perpetrated\\r\\nthese murders, now consulted together as to what was next to be done.\\r\\nMoranget was the nephew of La Salle. The valet and the Indian were his\\r\\ndevoted friends. Their death could not be concealed. It was certain\\r\\nthat La Salle would not allow it to go unavenged. Though punishment\\r\\nmight be postponed until they should emerge from their long and\\r\\nperilous journey through the wilderness, there could be no doubt that\\r\\nas soon as they should reach a French military post they would all die\\r\\nupon the scaffold.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey decided to return to the camp, enlist a few others on their side,\\r\\nkill La Salle, and others of his prominent friends, when unsuspicious\\r\\nof danger; and thus involving all the rest in their own criminality,\\r\\neffectually prevent any witnesses from rising against them. Probably in\\r\\nsome degree tortured by remorse, and trembling in view of the task\\r\\nwhich they had undertaken, they remained for two days, the 18th and\\r\\n19th, where they were, ostensibly employed in jerking the meat.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Salle, not knowing how to account for this long absence, became\\r\\nuneasy. He decided to go himself, taking a few others with him, to\\r\\nascertain the cause. To his friends he expressed serious apprehensions\\r\\nthat some great calamity had happened. M. Joutel was left in charge of\\r\\nthe camp, and La Salle, with Father Douay and another companion, set\\r\\nout in search of the lost ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nFather Douay gives the following account of the tragic scene which\\r\\nensued:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"All the way La Salle conversed with me of matters of piety, grace,\\r\\n    and predestination. He expatiated upon all his obligations to God,\\r\\n    for having saved him from so many dangers during the last twenty\\r\\n    years that he had traversed America. He seemed to me to be\\r\\n    peculiarly penetrated with a grateful sense of God\\'s kindness to\\r\\n    him. Suddenly I saw him plunged into a deep melancholy, for which\\r\\n    he himself could not account. He was so troubled that he no longer\\r\\n    seemed like himself. As this was an unusual state of mind with him,\\r\\n    I endeavored to rouse him from his lethargy.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Two leagues after, we found the bloody cravat of his valet. He\\r\\n    perceived two eagles flying over his head. At the same time he\\r\\n    discerned some of his people on the edge of the river. He\\r\\n    approached them, asking what had become of his nephew. They\\r\\n    answered incoherently, pointing to a spot where they said we should\\r\\n    find him. We proceeded some steps along the bank, to the fatal spot\\r\\n    where two of his murderers were hidden in the grass, one on each\\r\\n    side, with guns cocked. One missed Monsieur de la Salle. The one\\r\\n    firing at the same time shot him in the head. He died an hour\\r\\n    after, on the 19th of March 1687.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"I expected the same fate. But this danger did not occupy my\\r\\n    thoughts, penetrated with grief at so cruel a spectacle. I saw him\\r\\n    fall, a step from me, his face all full of blood. He had confessed\\r\\n    and performed his devotions just before we started. During his last\\r\\n    moments he manifested the spirit of a good Christian, especially in\\r\\n    the act of pardoning his murderers.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Thus died our wise commander, constant in adversity, intrepid,\\r\\n    generous, engaging, dexterous, skilful, capable of everything. He,\\r\\n    who for twenty years had softened the fierce temper of countless\\r\\n    savage tribes, was massacred by the hands of his own domestics,\\r\\n    whom he had loaded with caresses. He died in the prime of life, in\\r\\n    the midst of his enterprises, without having seen their success. I\\r\\n    could not leave the spot where he had expired, without having\\r\\n    buried him as well as I could. After which I raised a cross over\\r\\n    his grave.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn reference to the burial, Joutel gives a little different account. He\\r\\nsays: \"The shot which killed La Salle was the signal for the\\r\\naccomplices of the assassin to rush to the spot. With barbarous cruelty\\r\\nthey stripped him of his clothing, even to his shirt. The poor dead\\r\\nbody was treated with every indignity. The corpse was left, entirely\\r\\nnaked, to the voracity of wild beasts.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth of these accounts may be essentially true. The barbarities\\r\\npractised by the assassins may have preceded or followed the hasty\\r\\nburial of Douay. Father Douay, in his account, continues:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Occupied with these thoughts, which La Salle had a thousand times\\r\\n    suggested to us, while relating the events of the new discoveries,\\r\\n    I unceasingly adored the inscrutable designs of God in this conduct\\r\\n    of His Providence, uncertain still what fate He reserved for us, as\\r\\n    our desperadoes plotted nothing less than our destruction. We at\\r\\n    last entered the place where Monsieur Cavalier was. The assassins\\r\\n    entered the cabin unceremoniously, and seized all that was there. I\\r\\n    had arrived a moment before them. I had no need to speak; for as\\r\\n    soon as Cavalier beheld my countenance, all bathed in tears, he\\r\\n    exclaimed aloud:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"\\'Ah, my poor brother is dead.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"This holy ecclesiastic, whose virtue has been so often tried in\\r\\n    the apostolic labors of Canada, fell at once on his knees. I\\r\\n    myself, and some others did the same, to prepare to die the same\\r\\n    death. But the murderers, touched by some sentiment of compassion\\r\\n    at the sight of the venerable old man, and besides half-penitent\\r\\n    for the murders they had committed, resolved to spare us, on\\r\\n    condition that we should never return to France. But as they were\\r\\n    still undecided, and many of them wished to go home to France, we\\r\\n    heard them often say to one another, that they must get rid of us;\\r\\n    that otherwise we should accuse them before the tribunals, if we\\r\\n    once had them in the kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"The leader of these desperadoes, a wretch by the name of Duhaut,\\r\\n    at once assumed the supreme command. The company now consisted of\\r\\n    but seventeen. The timid ones, trembling for their lives, feigned\\r\\n    entire devotion to the cause of the assassins. Duhaut ruled with\\r\\n    an iron hand. It was manifest that the least indication of an\\r\\n    insubordinate spirit would lead to instant death. Some of the best\\r\\n    men were for organizing a conspiracy to assassinate the assassins.\\r\\n    But the priest Cavalier continually said no, repeating the words,\\r\\n    \\'Vengeance is mine. I will repay, saith the Lord.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is impossible to determine the precise spot where the murder of La\\r\\nSalle and his companions took place. We know that it was several days\\'\\r\\njourney west of the Cenis Indians, whose territory extended along the\\r\\nbanks of Trinity River, which empties into Galveston Bay. It is\\r\\ntherefore conjectured that it must have been near one of the streams\\r\\nflowing into the Brazos, in the heart of Texas, probably not far from\\r\\nwhere Washington now is.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVII.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The Penalty of Crime._\\r\\n\\r\\nNature\\'s Storms.

Silently they toiled along, drenched\\r\\nwith the falling rain, until noon, when the storm became so severe that\\r\\nthey were compelled to halt. They threw up their camp in a deep and\\r\\ndark ravine. The murderers could have no rest. They were in continual\\r\\nfear that the friends of La Salle would rise and kill them. Father\\r\\nDouay, M. Joutel, and La Salle\\'s brother the Chevalier, knew full well\\r\\nthat the murderers had the strongest possible incentive to kill them\\r\\nalso.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no storm so desolating, so ruinous to all happiness, as sin.\\r\\nCould these voyagers have continued their journey with fraternal love,\\r\\nits material obstacles could all have been pleasantly surmounted. But\\r\\nhenceforth, for them, there were no more sunny skies, no more blooming\\r\\nprairies, no more joyous gatherings and feastings around the camp fire.\\r\\nJourneying on, through a gloomy country, and in sombre weather, they\\r\\ncame, on the 24th, to a river. Most of the party swam across. Father\\r\\nDouay, M. Joutel, and Cavalier could not swim. Some friendly Indians\\r\\ncame along and, swimming by their side, helped them over. A journey of\\r\\nfour days more brought them to a large village of the Cenis Indians, on\\r\\na stream which they called by the same name.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe region was beautiful. There was no continuous forest, but extended,\\r\\nwell-watered plains, interspersed with groves of a great variety of\\r\\nmajestic trees. They frequently met with Indians, from whom they always\\r\\nreceived kind treatment. Most of the men encamped a few miles from the\\r\\nvillage, M. Joutel was sent, with three others, to purchase from them,\\r\\nif possible, some corn. One of the men thus sent forward was Hiens, one\\r\\nof the original conspirators with Duhaut. M. Joutel was annoyed in\\r\\naccompanying a murderer on this mission, but it was not safe to make\\r\\nany remonstrance. Duhaut kept careful guard over all the effects. He\\r\\nintrusted a few hatchets and knives to his envoys, with instructions to\\r\\npurchase corn, and, if possible, a horse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had not gone far before they saw three savages approaching them on\\r\\nhorseback. One had a hat and cloak, which he had probably obtained in\\r\\nsome way from the Spaniards. The other two were entirely naked. The\\r\\nthree had panniers closely woven of fibres of cane, and filled with\\r\\ncorn meal pounded or ground very fine. They had been sent forward by\\r\\ntheir chief, with the meal as a present, and to invite the strangers to\\r\\nvisit his village. After smoking together, and the Indians having\\r\\nreceived some knives and beads in return for their gift, the united\\r\\nparty set out for the village.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was still some distance to the village. Night had come. The horses\\r\\nof the travellers were weary and hungry. They therefore encamped in a\\r\\nrich meadow, by a rippling stream. Two of the Indians returned to their\\r\\nvillage. One remained with the strangers. The next morning they went\\r\\nforward, and were conducted by their Indian companion to the cabin of\\r\\nthe chief. They were received with very unusual courtly etiquette.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout a third of a mile from the village there was a very large\\r\\nbuilding, which we should call the town house, or the city hall. It was\\r\\nconstructed as the place for the gathering of all their great public\\r\\nassemblages. The floor was very neatly carpeted with finely woven mats.\\r\\nA very imposing procession was formed to escort the strangers from the\\r\\ncabin of the chief to this council house.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst in the procession came all the men of the village, venerable in\\r\\ncharacter and age. They were richly dressed, in very tasteful\\r\\npicturesque garments, of softly tanned deer-skin. These robes and\\r\\nleggins and scarfs were of different colors, of brilliant hue, and were\\r\\nprofusely decorated with fringes and embroidered with shells. They wore\\r\\nplumes of colored feathers upon their heads, which waved gracefully in\\r\\nthe gentle breeze. In their hands they held javelins, or bows, with\\r\\nquivers of arrows suspended on their shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn each side of the ancients, who were twelve in number, there were\\r\\nfiles of warriors, as if for their protection. They were all young men\\r\\nof admirable figure, painted and dressed, and armed as if on the\\r\\nwar-path. The procession being thus formed in front of the chief\\'s\\r\\ncabin, and the whole population of the village, many hundred in number,\\r\\nmen, women and children, gathered around to witness the spectacle, M.\\r\\nJoutel and his attendants, led by the chief, were brought out to be\\r\\nreceived by the ancients and conducted to the council house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese venerable men greeted them with much formality. Each one raised\\r\\nhis right hand to his head, and then performed a peculiar series of\\r\\nbows. They then embraced each one, gently throwing their arms around\\r\\nthe neck. This ceremony was followed by the presentation of the pipe of\\r\\nfriendship, each one taking but a few whiffs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cortÃ¨ge advanced to the council house. The guests were seated on\\r\\ncouches in the centre. The ancients, silently and with much dignity of\\r\\nmovement, took seats around them. A large multitude crowded the vacant\\r\\nspaces. They were feasted with the choicest viands of the Indians,\\r\\nboiled corn meal, cakes baked in the ashes, and truly delicious steaks\\r\\nof venison. Presents were interchanged, and kind speeches made, mainly\\r\\nby signs.\\r\\n\\r\\nM. Joutel informed them that it was his great desire to obtain corn for\\r\\ntheir long journey. They said that their supply was short, but that in\\r\\na neighboring village, at the distance of but a few leagues, there was\\r\\nan abundant supply. They also signified their readiness to accompany\\r\\ntheir guests to this village.\\r\\n\\r\\nA large party set out together. The trail led along the banks of one of\\r\\nthe branches of the Brazos. The region was delightful, the soil\\r\\nfertile, and quite a dense population blessed with abundance, peopled\\r\\nthe lovely valley. It might have been almost an Eden, but for the\\r\\nwickedness of fallen man. This powerful tribe the Cenis, was at war\\r\\nwith another tribe, called the Cannohantimos. Frequently the valley\\r\\nwould be swept by an irruption of fierce warriors, with gleaming\\r\\ntomahawks and poisoned arrows and demoniac yells. Conflagration, blood,\\r\\nand shrieks of misery ensued. The valley, which God had made so\\r\\nbeautiful for his children, those children had converted into a\\r\\nGethsemane, where all the fiends seemed struggling.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut our travellers passed up this valley in one of the serene and\\r\\nblooming spring mornings. There was a lull in war\\'s tempest, and a\\r\\nheavenly Father\\'s smile illumined all the scene. Large dome-like cabins\\r\\nand cultivated fields were met with all along the route. Many of these\\r\\ndwellings were sixty feet in diameter. They afforded perfect protection\\r\\nfrom wind and rain, were neatly carpeted, and gave ample accommodation\\r\\noften for four or five families.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne central fire, which was never permitted to go out, was common for\\r\\nall. There were no partitions. Each family occupied a certain portion\\r\\nof the space, and slept on comfortable beds, raised a foot or two from\\r\\nthe floor. They were naturally a very amiable people among themselves,\\r\\nand lived together on the most brotherly terms.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn cultivating the fields they worked together. Often a hundred men and\\r\\nwomen would meet to plant the field of one man. They would spend six or\\r\\nseven hours in carefully digging the field with wooden forks, and in\\r\\nplanting seeds of corn, beans, melons, and other vegetables. They would\\r\\nthen have a feast, provided by the one in whose behalf they were\\r\\nlaboring. This would be followed by games and dances. The men dug the\\r\\nsoil, while the women planted and covered the seed. These children of\\r\\nthe prairie must have found, in these co-operative labors, far more\\r\\nenjoyment than the solitary farmer can find in his lonely toils. Thus\\r\\nthis band would pass from field to field throughout the whole village.\\r\\n\\r\\nM. Joutel says that, so far as he could learn, they did not seem to\\r\\nhave any definite idea of God. They had certain shadowy notions of some\\r\\nbeing or beings above themselves, but apparently did not consider that\\r\\nthese beings took any special interest in scenes occurring here below.\\r\\nUpon the subject of religion it could hardly be said that they had any\\r\\ndefinite idea. They had no temples, no priests, no worship. Their minds\\r\\nwere in a state of vacuity. In this respect they were much in the\\r\\ncondition of mere animals. They had certain ceremonies, the meaning of\\r\\nwhich they could not explain, except that such was their custom--that\\r\\ntheir fathers did so. Be it remembered that this is the account which\\r\\nis given of the Cenis Indians. Others were more enlightened, and others\\r\\nless. There are well-authenticated accounts of some Indians, who were\\r\\nin the habit of daily prayer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey reached the village in the early evening. Couriers had preceded\\r\\nthem to announce their coming. The principal men came out and conducted\\r\\nthem to a cabin, which had been prepared for their reception. After\\r\\nsupper and a social pipe, the guests were left to the repose which they\\r\\ngreatly needed. The cabin assigned to them was one of the largest in\\r\\nthe place. It had belonged to a chief who had recently died. A gentle\\r\\nfire was burning in the centre. There were several women in the cabin,\\r\\nattending to sundry household duties. The guests slept soundly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning was the 1st of April, 1687. The fathers of the village\\r\\nagain called upon the strangers with much courtesy of demeanor, and\\r\\nbrought them an ample breakfast. Presents were exchanged, and a very\\r\\nfine horse was purchased for a hatchet. The day was spent in purchasing\\r\\ncorn, which was placed in panniers, to be carried on the backs of the\\r\\nhorses.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere were found three Frenchmen who, a year before had deserted from La\\r\\nSalle. With painted faces, and in the dress of savages, no one could\\r\\ndistinguish them from others of the tribe. The fact that in one year\\r\\nthey had almost entirely forgotten their native language, seems at\\r\\nfirst thought almost incredible. But it must be remembered that they\\r\\nwere vagabond sailors, with no mental culture, who could neither read\\r\\nnor write, and with whom language was merely a succession of sounds,\\r\\nwhich were very easily obliterated from the memory.\\r\\n\\r\\nM. Joutel sent his companions back to the camp with the corn which had\\r\\nalready been purchased, while he remained to obtain more. Alone in the\\r\\ncabin, far away in the wilderness, the companion of murderers, and a\\r\\nvery uncertain fate before him, he could not sleep. At midnight, as he\\r\\nwas reclining upon his mat, absorbed in thought, he saw, by the light\\r\\nof the fire, an Indian enter the cabin, with a bow and two arrows in\\r\\nhis hand. He took a seat near where M. Joutel was apparently sleeping.\\r\\n\\r\\nM. Joutel spoke to him. He made no reply; but arose and took another\\r\\nseat near the fire. M. Joutel, being sleepless, followed him, to enter,\\r\\nif possible, into conversation. Fixing his eyes earnestly upon the\\r\\ntaciturn Indian, he saw, to his surprise, that he was one of the French\\r\\ndeserters whom he had formerly known very well. His name was Grollet.\\r\\nHe informed M. Joutel that he had a comrade by the name of Ruter, who\\r\\ndid not dare to come with him, from fear that he should be punished by\\r\\nLa Salle, of whose death they had not heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They had,\" writes M. Joutel, \"in so short a time so entirely\\r\\ncontracted the habits of the savages, as to become thorough savages\\r\\nthemselves. They were naked, and their faces and bodies were covered\\r\\nwith painted figures. Each of them had taken several wives. They had\\r\\naccompanied the warriors of the tribe to battle; and with their guns\\r\\nhad killed many of the enemy, which had given them great renown. Having\\r\\nexpended all their powder and bullets, their guns had become useless.\\r\\nThey had therefore taken bows and arrows and had become quite skilful\\r\\nin their use. As to religion, they never had any. The libertine life\\r\\nthey were now practising was quite to their taste.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGrollet seemed much moved when he heard of the death of La Salle and\\r\\nthe others. Upon being questioned whether he had ever heard the Indians\\r\\nspeak of the Mississippi, he said that he had not, but that he had\\r\\noften heard them speak of a very large river, about five days\\' journey\\r\\nnortheast of them, and upon whose banks there were very many Indian\\r\\ntribes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two next days M. Joutel continued purchasing corn. It could not be\\r\\nbought in large quantities, but many families could spare a little. On\\r\\nthe 8th of April he returned to the camp, with three horses laden with\\r\\ncorn. During this delay the murderer, Duhaut, had had many hours for\\r\\nreflection. To return to a French military or trading post, accompanied\\r\\nby the witnesses of his crime, was certain death. To attempt to kill\\r\\nall those not implicated in the murder, would be a very serious\\r\\nundertaking; especially as they were now on their guard, and the\\r\\nassassins had begun to quarrel among themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuhaut formed the plan of turning back, with his confederates, to the\\r\\nsettlement which they had left at the bay of St. Louis. Where he\\r\\ndesigned to build a vessel and to sail for the West India Islands, The\\r\\npersons whom Duhaut greatly feared were Father Douay, M. Joutel, La\\r\\nSalle\\'s brother, M. Chevalier, and a young man who was called Young\\r\\nChevalier. The head murderer now adopted the policy of separating these\\r\\nmen from the rest of the company, that he might freely talk with his\\r\\nconfederates of his plans. M. Joutel and his associates were also well\\r\\npleased with this arrangement, for they too could now talk freely.\\r\\nDuhaut tried to compel the other party to go back with him. But they\\r\\nabsolutely refused. Finding that he could not force them, and that they\\r\\nwere resolved to continue their journey to the French settlements, and\\r\\nthat thus they might send an armed ship to capture the murderers; he\\r\\nresolved to continue in their company. Probably he hoped that some\\r\\nopportunity would occur in which he could cut them off.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were five men who were active participants in the assassination.\\r\\nDuhaut, the instigator, Hiens, who was the next most prominent in the\\r\\nplot, and three others, who were rather their tools, Liotot, Tessier,\\r\\nand LarchevÃ¨que. The rage of Hiens was kindled only against Moranget.\\r\\nHe was willing to kill Moranget\\'s two companions that they might not be\\r\\nwitnesses against the murderers. He would conceal their bodies, and\\r\\nwould have it understood that they had wandered away and become lost,\\r\\nor that they had been captured by the Indians.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiotot was appointed to strike the fatal blows upon Moranget and his\\r\\ncompanions with the hatchet, while the others stood ready, with their\\r\\nguns, to aid, should it be necessary. The subsequent murder of La Salle\\r\\nwas contrary to the wishes of Hiens. Duhaut and LarchevÃ¨que waylaid\\r\\nhim. They both fired nearly at the same moment. The bullet of\\r\\nLarchevÃ¨que, either intentionally or by accident, passed wide of its\\r\\nmark. Duhaut\\'s bullet pierced the brain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no sympathy between Hiens and Duhaut. When the latter so\\r\\narrogantly assumed the command, Hiens became very restive, and was\\r\\nwaiting for an opportunity to dethrone him. Trembling in view of the\\r\\nperil of approaching the French settlements, and having no disposition\\r\\nto imbrue his hands any farther in the blood of innocent men whose\\r\\nconduct had only won his regard, he was extremely anxious to return to\\r\\nthe bay of St. Louis.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinding that Duhaut had altered his plan and had decided to continue on\\r\\nthe Mississippi, he took one or two of his companions aside and deeply\\r\\nimpressed them with a sense of the danger they would thus encounter.\\r\\nThey conspired to kill Duhaut and his most resolute supporter Liotot.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiens then entered into a secret alliance with the savages, promising\\r\\nthat if they would aid him in his plans, he would stop the march of the\\r\\nparty toward the Mississippi, and with several others would join them,\\r\\nwith their all-powerful muskets, in a hostile expedition they were\\r\\nabout to make against a neighboring tribe. He also enlisted, in\\r\\nco-operation with his plans, the French deserters who had already\\r\\nbecome savages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus strengthened, and with twenty-two well-armed savages in his train,\\r\\nhe sought Duhaut. In brief words he thus addressed him:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have decided to go on to the French settlements. It is a danger\\r\\nwhich we dare not encounter. I therefore demand that you divide with us\\r\\nall the arms, ammunition, and goods we have. You may then pursue your\\r\\nown course and we will pursue ours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout waiting for any reply he drew a pistol and shot Duhaut through\\r\\nthe heart. The miserable man staggered back a few steps and dropped\\r\\ndead. At the same moment one of his accomplices, Ruter, with his\\r\\nmusket, shot down Liotot, inflicting a mortal wound. As the man was\\r\\nstruggling in death\\'s agonies, Ruter advanced and discharged a\\r\\npistol-shot into the convulsed body. Douay writes, \"His hair, and then\\r\\nhis shirt and clothes took fire, and wrapped him in flames, and in this\\r\\ntorment he expired.\" It was the intention of Hiens also to kill\\r\\nLarchevÃ¨que, but he, terror-stricken, escaped by flight.\\r\\n\\r\\nA small hole was dug, and the two dead bodies were thrown in and\\r\\ncovered up. M. Joutel was present, and witnessed this dreadful scene.\\r\\nHe writes:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Those murders took place before my eyes. I was dreadfully\\r\\n    agitated, and supposing that my death was immediately to follow,\\r\\n    instinctively seized my musket in self-defence. But Hiens cried\\r\\n    out:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"\\'You have nothing to fear. We do not wish to harm you. We only\\r\\n    avenge the death of our patron La Salle. Could I have prevented his\\r\\n    death I certainly should have done so.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe savages were astonished at this scene. They were not at all\\r\\nprepared for it. But Hiens explained to them that it was done to avenge\\r\\nmurders which they had committed; and that as Duhaut and Liotot had\\r\\nresolved to take with them all the guns and ammunition, it was\\r\\nnecessary to kill them that Hiens and his associates might join the\\r\\nIndians in their war party. This statement seemed to give entire\\r\\nsatisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiens was now the leader of the rapidly dwindling band. He informed\\r\\nthem that he should take several of his companions, with the guns and\\r\\nammunition, and accompany the Indians on their military expedition. In\\r\\nthe meantime, until his return, they were to remain in charge of\\r\\nfriendly Indians. Thus they were virtually prisoners. Their means for\\r\\ncontinuing the journey were taken from them. Probably Hiens intended\\r\\nthat they should never return to France.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in May, the war party commenced its march. Hiens accompanied the\\r\\nwarriors, with four of his party, and two of the French deserters. This\\r\\nmade seven Frenchmen, well armed with powder and ball. As they were to\\r\\nencounter foes who bore only bows and arrows, the French allies became\\r\\nan immense acquisition to the force of the expedition. Each one of\\r\\nthese had a horse. Hiens exacted a promise, from those he left behind,\\r\\nthat they would not leave the village until his return.\\r\\n\\r\\nA fortnight passed away. Those who remained were encamped at a little\\r\\ndistance outside of the village. They were frequently visited by the\\r\\nmen and the women, who ever manifested the most friendly feelings. They\\r\\ncould converse only by signs, and their attempted communication of\\r\\nideas was not very satisfactory.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 18th of the month a great crowd came rushing out to the\\r\\nencampment. The men and women were painted and decorated. Their smiling\\r\\nfaces, songs, and dances indicated plainly that they had received\\r\\ntidings of a great victory. For several hours, there was exhibited a\\r\\nvery picturesque scene of feasting, smoking, and barbarian jollity. In\\r\\nthe midst of these wild festivities, a courier arrived, stating that\\r\\nthe victorious army was returning, and that they had killed more than\\r\\nforty of their enemies. The next day they arrived.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey brought very glowing accounts of the achievements of the French\\r\\nwith their muskets. They found the foe drawn up in battle array in a\\r\\ndense grove. Approaching within musket-shot, but not within arrow-shot,\\r\\nthe French with deliberate aim shot down forty-eight of the foe. The\\r\\nrest in terror fled. The shouting Cenis pursued. They took a large\\r\\nnumber of women and children as prisoners, most of whom they instantly\\r\\nkilled and scalped. Two mature girls they brought back with them to\\r\\nsubject to fiend-like torture. One of them had been cruelly scalped.\\r\\nFaint and bleeding she could endure but little more. An Indian,\\r\\nborrowing a pistol from a Frenchman, deliberately shot her through the\\r\\nhead, saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take that message to your nation. Tell them that ere long we will\\r\\nserve them all in the same way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other maiden was reserved for all the horrors of demoniac torture\\r\\nby the women and the girls. These were arranged in a circle. The poor\\r\\ngirl was led into the middle of them. They were all armed with strong\\r\\nsticks sharply pointed. They then, with hideous yells, fell\\r\\ntumultuously upon her, like hounds upon a hare. She soon dropped to the\\r\\nground beneath their blows. They thrust their sharp sticks into her\\r\\nbody. With sinewy arms these savage women beat her in the face, over\\r\\nthe head, upon every part of her frame until her body presented but a\\r\\nmangled mass of blood. As she lay upon the ground scarcely breathing, a\\r\\nburly Indian came forward, and with one blow of a club crushed in her\\r\\nbrain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day there was another great celebration. Great honor was\\r\\nconferred upon the French who had caused the victory. The Indian\\r\\nwarriors had done but little more than kill the women and children whom\\r\\nthey had taken prisoners, and scalp all the slain. After several\\r\\nspeeches were made by their orators, a procession was formed. Each\\r\\nwarrior had a bow and two arrows in his hand, and was accompanied by\\r\\none of his wives, who, like a servant or rather like the squire of the\\r\\nknights of old, waved in her hands the gory scalps, revolting trophies\\r\\nof her husband\\'s chivalric achievements. The whole day was devoted to\\r\\nbarbarian feasting and carousing.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiens the next day held an amicable conference with M. Joutel and his\\r\\nfriends, to come to some agreement as to their future operations. \"I am\\r\\nnot willing,\" he said, \"to return to the French settlements. It would\\r\\ninevitably cost me my head. But I am willing to divide all our property\\r\\nequally between the two parties. Those who wish may accompany Joutel;\\r\\nothers may remain with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe division was made. M. Joutel, Father Douay, M. Cavalier, and his\\r\\nnephew, young Cavalier, and three others, De Marle, Tessier and\\r\\nBarthelmy, composed the party which was to return to the French\\r\\nsettlements. Thus the band of twenty which had left the bay of St.\\r\\nLouis had dwindled down to seven. They had three horses, thirty\\r\\nhatchets, five dozen knives, thirty pounds of powder, and thirty pounds\\r\\nof bullets. Three Indians volunteered as guides for a portion of the\\r\\nway.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Cenis chief found that M. Joutel was about to undertake so\\r\\nlong and perilous a journey, with so small a band, he was astonished,\\r\\nand did everything in his power to dissuade him from such an\\r\\nenterprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you will remain with us,\" said he, \"we will give you cabins and\\r\\nwives, and food in abundance. The dangers before you are appalling, not\\r\\nonly from hostile Indians, whose territories you must pass through, but\\r\\nfrom the innumerable difficulties of broad rivers and deep marshes you\\r\\nmust encounter by the way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nM. Joutel and his companions were firm. Very reluctantly the chief\\r\\nconsented that the three Indian guides should, for a time, accompany\\r\\nthem. It was about the 25th of May, when they resumed their march from\\r\\nthe village of the Cenis. The second day they came to a broad river,\\r\\nwhich they crossed on a raft, swimming their horses. The country was\\r\\nquite densely populated. They daily passed cabins and villages of the\\r\\nIndians, but encountered no opposition. We have minute accounts of\\r\\ntheir reception in many of these villages. All are essentially the same\\r\\nwith those which we have already narrated.\\r\\n\\r\\nDay after day, with occasional halts in consequence of rains, the\\r\\ntravellers pressed on, through the month of May and to the middle of\\r\\nJune. Their route was generally in a northeastern direction. Their path\\r\\nled them through a rugged country of forests, ravines, and rivers. The\\r\\naverage territory of each Indian tribe was about twenty miles square.\\r\\nFriendly Indians were always found to guide them, as it were, from post\\r\\nto post on their way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVIII.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The Close of the Drama._\\r\\n\\r\\nLudicrous Scene. Death of M. Marle. Sympathy of the Savages. Barbaric\\r\\nCeremonies. The Mississippi Reached. Joyful Interview. Ascending the\\r\\nRiver. Incidents by the Way. The Beautiful Illinois. Weary Detention.\\r\\nThe Voyage to Mackinac. Thence to Quebec. Departure for France. Fate of\\r\\nthe Colony.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter part of June they approached a village, when a large number\\r\\nof men came out to greet them, and to escort them in. The Indians\\r\\ninsisted upon carrying the Frenchmen into the village upon their backs,\\r\\nsaying that it was their invariable custom in the reception of guests.\\r\\nThey were constrained to submit. Seven savages stooped down, and each\\r\\none received one of the guests upon his shoulders. Others led the\\r\\nhorses.\\r\\n\\r\\nM. Joutel was a very tall man and very heavy. He also carried a gun,\\r\\ntwo pistols, some powder and lead, and several articles of clothing.\\r\\nThe savage who undertook to carry him, was a small man, so that M.\\r\\nJoutel\\'s feet almost touched the ground. As he tottered beneath his\\r\\nburden, two other savages came to his aid, helping to sustain him by\\r\\nthe legs. Thus he had three porters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Frenchmen, whose vivacity seemed never long to forsake them, found\\r\\nit very difficult to restrain their laughter in view of the ludicrous\\r\\nspectacle they presented. It was three-quarters of a mile to the\\r\\nvillage. The porters, quite exhausted, surrendered their burdens in the\\r\\ncabin of the chief. The Indians wore but little clothing; some of them\\r\\nnone at all. They brought water, saying that it was their custom to\\r\\nwash their guests, but as they perceived that the Frenchmen were\\r\\nencumbered with garments, they would wash only their faces.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this ceremony, they were placed upon a platform about four feet\\r\\nhigh, and addressed in long speeches of welcome. As usual there was\\r\\nsmoking, feasting, and the exchange of presents. They then opened a\\r\\nvery successful traffic with the Indians for the purchase of corn.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese Indians had never heard the report of a gun. They were astonished\\r\\nin view of the deadly power of the invisible bullet; and they implored\\r\\nthe strangers to remain with them and aid them in a war expedition.\\r\\nThough M. Joutel was the historian of this expedition, they seem, by\\r\\ncommon consent, to have regarded La Salle\\'s brother, M. Cavalier, as\\r\\ntheir leader. He informed the Indians that they must hasten on their\\r\\nway, but that they hoped, ere long, to return and bring with them guns,\\r\\npowder, hatchets, knives, and other articles to exchange for their\\r\\nfurs. This pleased them greatly.\\r\\n\\r\\nA melancholy accident occurred at this place. M. Marle went into the\\r\\nriver to bathe. Accidentally he got beyond his depth and was drowned.\\r\\nThe savages manifested the deepest sympathy on the occasion. They\\r\\nrushed to the spot in large numbers, plunged into the water, regained\\r\\nthe lifeless body, and with mournful wailings bore it back to the\\r\\nvillage. They watched with intensest interest the rites of Christian\\r\\nburial. The grave of the unfortunate man was in a beautiful grove, on\\r\\nthe banks of the river. His mourning companions raised over the spot a\\r\\ncross, the touching emblem of the great atoning sacrifice for sin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is our duty to testify,\" writes M. Joutel, \"to the kindness of this\\r\\naffectionate people. Their humanity, manifested in this sad accident,\\r\\nwas very remarkable. Their sympathy in our grief was greater than we\\r\\ncould have experienced in any part of Europe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were four very pleasant and populous villages here, situated near\\r\\neach other. The inhabitants seemed to be united in the most fraternal\\r\\nalliance. And yet these people, who could be so gentle, tender and\\r\\nsympathetic in receiving their friends, could be as merciless as demons\\r\\nin torturing their enemies.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 30th of June, the travellers again took up their line of march.\\r\\nThere was a wide river, near by, to be crossed. They had spent several\\r\\ndays in this village, receiving unbounded acts of politeness and\\r\\nhospitality from the people. The men and the women alike vied in\\r\\ndelicate attentions, such as could not have been expected from savages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a broad and deep river near by to be crossed. The chief and a\\r\\nlarge escort of the natives accompanied them to the river, and paddled\\r\\nthem over in their canoes, swimming the horses. M. Chevalier, in taking\\r\\nleave of his friends, gave them some rich presents, not forgetting to\\r\\nmake the women happy in the gift of some gorgeous beads. Several\\r\\nIndians guided the party to the next tribe, at a distance of about\\r\\nthirty miles. Here again they were received in the cabin of the chief\\r\\nwith unbounded hospitality.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter being welcomed with their many ceremonials of greeting, guides\\r\\nwere furnished to accompany them to the next tribe. Thus they pressed\\r\\non, day after day, with but occasional delays. Their route lay through\\r\\na very rich country, abounding with deer and turkeys and prairie\\r\\nchickens. Village after village they entered. Tribe after tribe they\\r\\nmet. But everywhere they encountered the same invariable hospitality.\\r\\nOn one occasion a group of singers came to their cabin, and treated\\r\\nthem with a serenade of plaintive music. At the same time one of their\\r\\nnumber crowned M. Chevalier with a beautiful head-dress of colored\\r\\nplumes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ceremony, on this occasion, was very elaborate, in which the\\r\\nfemales as well as the men took an active part. Two girls, of\\r\\nremarkably graceful form, and whose symmetric limbs were but slightly\\r\\nveiled, were brought, evidently without any intentional immodesty, into\\r\\nsuch affectionate contact with M. Chevalier, as greatly to confuse him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was quite evident that the Indians did not expect that their wealthy\\r\\nguests would receive these attentions without making them some return.\\r\\nThey seem to have regarded themselves as abundantly rewarded by a gift\\r\\nof a hatchet, four knives, and a few beads. They regarded the French as\\r\\nsuperior beings, and were amazed and awed by the report of the guns,\\r\\nand the deadly flight of the bullet. They entreated the strangers to\\r\\nremain with them, offering them cabins and food and wives.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had reached a broken, hilly country, with ravines and forests, and\\r\\nIndian trails leading in many directions. Guides were greatly needed;\\r\\nand guides were always furnished. On the evening of the 24th of July,\\r\\nthey came to the banks of a river of unusual flood and breadth. To\\r\\ntheir surprise and delight they saw, upon the opposite bank, a large\\r\\ncross, and near by a spacious log-cabin, such as the French were\\r\\naccustomed to rear at their stations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No one,\" writes M. Joutel, \"can imagine the joy with which this sight\\r\\ninspired our hearts. We threw ourselves upon our knees, and with\\r\\ntearful eyes thanked God for having so safely led us. We had no doubt\\r\\nthat those on the opposite shore were Frenchmen, and the cross proved\\r\\nthat they were fellow Christians.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inmates of the log-cabin caught sight of the strangers. Probably\\r\\ntheir dress indicated that they were not Indians. They fired two\\r\\nmuskets as a salute. The salute was promptly returned. Immediately\\r\\nseveral canoes pushed off, from the opposite bank, paddled by Indians,\\r\\nand in which the travellers saw two men in European dress. They were\\r\\ntwo Frenchmen, M. Charpentier and M. Launay, both from Rouen. Their\\r\\nstation was on the northern bank of the Arkansas River, not far from\\r\\nits entrance into the Mississippi. Lieutenant Tonti had established the\\r\\npost, that he might receive news from La Salle\\'s expedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this interview, as in nearly all the scenes of earth, joy and grief\\r\\nwere blended. The travellers felt that now they were safe, and that\\r\\nreturn to friends and home was secure. But all wept over the death of\\r\\nLa Salle, for he was revered and loved by all who knew him. There was\\r\\nquite a large number of Indians at the station. They unloaded the\\r\\nhorses, brought up the baggage, and men and women crowded around with\\r\\nunfeigned joy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a short time the Indians all left the cabin, and the white men\\r\\nheld a conference together, narrating past events. Lieutenant Tonti had\\r\\nstationed six men at that post. They were to remain there until they\\r\\nshould receive tidings of La Salle\\'s landing at the mouth of the\\r\\nMississippi. As the months passed away, and they heard nothing of his\\r\\nexpedition, four of the party went to fort St. Louis on the Illinois\\r\\nRiver, leaving but two behind. It was decided that it was best to\\r\\nconceal the death of La Salle until it could be communicated by his\\r\\nbrother, Chevalier, to the court in France. In the meantime the\\r\\nimpression was to be left that he was still superintending the affairs\\r\\nof the settlement at the bay of St. Louis.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a little distance from the log-cabin of the French there was quite a\\r\\ngroup of Indian wigwams. The chief soon came and invited the newly\\r\\narrived strangers to dine with him and his chief men. Mats were spread\\r\\nin the large cabin of the chief, and an ample feast provided. At the\\r\\nclose of the entertainment M. Cavalier addressed them, in substance as\\r\\nfollows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We accompanied the Chevalier La Salle from France, to establish a\\r\\nsettlement at the mouth of the Mississippi River. We left our colony on\\r\\nthe shores of the Gulf of Mexico, and are on our way to Canada. We have\\r\\npassed through the territories of very many tribes, who have all\\r\\ntreated us in the kindest manner. It is our intention to return from\\r\\nCanada to the mouth of the river, with a large supply of merchandise.\\r\\nThe people, through whose countries we have passed, have furnished us\\r\\nwith guides. We ask the same favor of you, with canoes to ascend the\\r\\nriver, and with a supply of food. The guides shall be well rewarded,\\r\\nand we will pay you for all the supplies with which you may furnish\\r\\nus.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this was very easily said, through an interpreter. The chief\\r\\nexpressed his surprise that they could have passed through so many\\r\\ntribes without having been either killed or robbed. He said that he\\r\\nwould immediately send couriers to the other villages of his tribe, to\\r\\ninform them of the wishes of the Frenchmen and to decide what could be\\r\\ndone to aid them in their object.\\r\\n\\r\\nM. Joutel gives a very alluring account of the situation and structure\\r\\nof this village. It was delightfully situated on an elevated plain\\r\\ncommanding an extensive view of the river and of the adjacent country.\\r\\nThe wigwams were substantially built, presenting very comfortable\\r\\ninteriors. The region around was almost crowded with buffaloes, deer,\\r\\nantelopes, and a vast variety of prairie and water-fowls. Fruit trees\\r\\nand vines were abundant, and they were richly laden with their\\r\\ndelicious burdens. Extended fields were waving luxuriantly with the\\r\\ngolden corn. Fish of many kinds were taken from the river. It is indeed\\r\\na glowing account which the pen of the historian gives of this favored\\r\\nland.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tribe at that point was called the Arkansas. They occupied four\\r\\nlarge villages. Two of these villages were on the Arkansas River, and\\r\\ntwo upon the Mississippi. These savages did everything in their power\\r\\nto testify the pleasure with which they received the strangers. Some of\\r\\ntheir ceremonies were so tedious that the guests would gladly have\\r\\navoided them. A delegation of the chiefs, from the other villages, was\\r\\nsoon assembled. A very formal council was held. It was decided that the\\r\\nfour villages should furnish one large boat, and one man from each\\r\\nvillage to aid in navigating it, and also the needful supply of food.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of M. Cavalier\\'s party, M. Barthelmy, who was a young man from\\r\\nParis, weary with the long journey he had already taken, and charmed\\r\\nwith the friendly character of the natives and the Eden-like region\\r\\nthey had found, decided to remain there. The horses also were left.\\r\\nThey had, as they judged, a voyage of twelve hundred miles from the\\r\\nmouth of the Arkansas to the mouth of the Illinois. They had travelled,\\r\\naccording to their estimate, seven hundred and fifty miles from their\\r\\nsettlement on the Gulf.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French party had now dwindled to five persons. The boat in which\\r\\nthey embarked was forty feet long. Fifteen Indians, men and women,\\r\\nentered the boat with them, to accompany them a part of the way. The\\r\\nwindings of the river were such that it required a voyage of several\\r\\nleagues to reach its mouth. It would seem, from the narrative, that\\r\\nthey reached a village at the mouth of the river on the 29th. Here they\\r\\nexchanged their large and heavy periagua, for two light canoes, with\\r\\nwhich to ascend against the swift current of the Mississippi.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day they made twenty-four miles, and reached Cappa, the last\\r\\nvillage of the Arkansas on the Mississippi. Here the chief contrived to\\r\\ndetain them a day, that the Indians might enjoy a few hours of barbaric\\r\\nfestivity. On the 2d of August the party reÃ«mbarked, nine in number,\\r\\nfive Frenchmen and four Indians. The rapidity of the current was such\\r\\nthat they were frequently compelled to cross the river to take\\r\\nadvantage of the eddies. Sometimes, at points in the river, the flow\\r\\nwas so swift that they were compelled to land, and carry the canoes and\\r\\nall their luggage on their shoulders around the point.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first night they encamped upon an island for greater security. The\\r\\nIndians in that vicinity had a bad reputation. The hardships of this\\r\\nvoyage were very great. It was necessary for each one to ply the paddle\\r\\nwith the utmost energy. They had often marshes to wade, dense forests\\r\\nto cut their way through, and desert plains to traverse beneath the\\r\\nrays of a blistering sun.\\r\\n\\r\\nWeary days and nights came and went. Long accustomed to every variety\\r\\nof wilderness life, there was no novelty to charm them. On the 19th of\\r\\nAugust they reached the mouth of the Ohio. Occasionally they landed to\\r\\nshoot a buffalo or a deer or a turkey. Their Indian attendants now\\r\\nmanifested a disposition to leave them, which caused the Frenchmen\\r\\ngreat alarm. Should the Indians stealthily, at night, take the canoes\\r\\nand descend the swift current of the stream, pursuit would be impossible,\\r\\nand the travellers would be left on the banks of the river, in a truly\\r\\ndeplorable condition. This rendered it necessary for them to keep a\\r\\nconstant watch, with their arms in their hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this state of anxiety they continued their laborious voyage until\\r\\nthe 30th of August, when they reached the mouth of the Missouri River.\\r\\nOn the 2d of August they passed the famous painting on the rocks to\\r\\nwhich we have before alluded. On the 3d of September they joyfully left\\r\\nthe Mississippi, and entered the more placid current of the Illinois.[2]\\r\\nThey judged it to be one hundred and eighty miles from the Ohio to the\\r\\nIllinois.\\r\\n\\r\\n      [2] M. Douay says, the 5th of September. These slight discrepancies\\r\\n      in dates are very frequent.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon this river they found a great and delightful change of scenery.\\r\\nThe richest verdure and bloom of summer were all around them. Meadows,\\r\\nand prairies, and lawn-like groves crowded with game, constantly\\r\\nregaled the eye. The gentle flow of the river greatly relieved them\\r\\nfrom the fatigue of the paddle. Day after day they ascended the\\r\\ncharming stream. Night after night they enjoyed encampment in lovely\\r\\ngroves, beneath serene skies, and feasting upon the choicest game. They\\r\\nfrequently came to villages and encampments of the Illinois Indians,\\r\\nwith whom they felt entirely at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 11th of September a solitary Indian came down to the bank of the\\r\\nriver, and hailed them. They understood his language, and informed him\\r\\nthat they had come from M. de la Salle, and that they were bound to the\\r\\nstation, farther up the river. He ran back to the encampment with the\\r\\nnews. The whole multitude came rushing down to the river, with joyous\\r\\nshoutings; and several guns were fired by them in salute. The salute\\r\\nwas returned from the boats. This was a band of the numerous tribe of\\r\\nIllinois Indians from the region of Kaskaskia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French fort on the Illinois River, as we have mentioned, was called\\r\\nSt. Louis. The Indians said that Lieutenant Tonti was not then at the\\r\\nfort, but that he had accompanied a party of their warriors in an\\r\\nexpedition against the Iroquois. They urged the voyagers to land and\\r\\ntake some food with them. But the Frenchmen declined. Being now so near\\r\\nwhat they deemed their journey\\'s end, they were eager to press on their\\r\\nway.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt two o\\'clock in the afternoon of Sunday, the 14th of September, 1687,\\r\\nthe weary and way-worn travellers reached the trading and military post\\r\\nof St. Louis. Compared with the humble wigwams of the Indians, the fort\\r\\nassumed majestic proportions, standing upon an eminence which commanded\\r\\nan extensive view of the region around. A group of Indians was gathered\\r\\nupon the bank. When informed that the strangers were from the\\r\\nsettlement of La Salle, they ran back to the fort with the joyful\\r\\ntidings. Immediately a Frenchman was seen, rushing down to the river,\\r\\nfollowed by a tumultuous group of Indians. M. Joutel writes:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"We returned together to the fort, where we found three Frenchmen.\\r\\n    They inquired of us of the Chevalier de la Salle. We informed them\\r\\n    that he had accompanied us a part of the way, and that we had left\\r\\n    him about one hundred and twenty miles south of the great Cenis\\r\\n    nation; and that he was then in good health. In that statement\\r\\n    there was nothing which was untrue; for M. Cavalier and I, who said\\r\\n    this, were not present at his death. He had left us in good health.\\r\\n    I have already spoken of the reasons which induced us to conceal\\r\\n    his death until we should arrive in France.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon entering the fort, the first movement was to go to the chapel in a\\r\\nbody, with prayers and the _Te Deum_, to return thanks to God, for\\r\\nhaving conducted them so safely on their long and perilous way. La\\r\\nSalle was universally beloved and revered. His noble bearing, his\\r\\nwinning deportment, his familiarity with Indian languages, his\\r\\nauthority derived from the king, his extended explorations and perilous\\r\\nadventures, and his pure and sincerely devout spirit, caused him to be\\r\\nregarded as eminently the great man of the pioneers in this new world.\\r\\nHe was Alonzo did everything in his power to redeem the captives, and\\r\\nthat he ordered the dead to be buried, weeping over their misfortunes,\\r\\nand praying most earnestly for the salvation of their souls.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was the wonderful career of La Salle. Next to Columbus, he was the\\r\\nmost illustrious of the pioneers of the New World. It would be\\r\\ndifficult to find, in history, any one who has displayed in a higher\\r\\ndegree the noble qualities of energy, courage, and perseverance,\\r\\ncombined with the more gentle virtues of tenderness, humanity, and\\r\\namiability. Adversity seemed to have no power to dishearten him. His\\r\\ncharacter was pure, and we have no reason to doubt that he was in heart\\r\\na sincere Christian. In the past history of our country, there are but\\r\\nfew names which are entitled to stand so high on its roll of fame, as\\r\\nthat of the Chevalier de la Salle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE END.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Adventures of the Chevalier De La\\r\\nSalle and His Companions, in Their Explorations of the Prairies, Forests, Lakes, and Rivers, of the New World, and Their Interviews with the Savage Tribes, Two Hundred Years Ago, by John S.

He had so\\r\\nmany virtues that there is no need of exaggerating them; so few\\r\\nimperfections that they need not be concealed. The writer has\\r\\nendeavored to give a perfectly accurate view of his character, and of\\r\\nthat great struggle, in which he took so conspicuous a part, which\\r\\nsecured the Independence of the United States. Probably there can no\\r\\nwhere be found, within the same limits, so vivid a picture of Life in\\r\\nAmerica, one hundred years ago, as the career of Franklin presents.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis volume is the twelfth of the Library Series of Pioneers and\\r\\nPatriots. The series presents a graphic history of our country from\\r\\nits discovery.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. _Christopher Columbus_ reveals to us the West Indies, and gives a\\r\\nnarrative of wonders unsurpassed in fact or fable.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. _De Soto_ conducts us to Florida, and leads us through scenes of\\r\\nromance, crime, blood and woe--through many Indian tribes, across the\\r\\ncontinent, to the Mississippi, where he finds his melancholy grave.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. _La Salle_, and his heroic companions, traversed thousands of miles\\r\\nof majestic lakes and unknown rivers, and introduces us to innumerable\\r\\nbarbaric tribes. There is no other writer, who, from his own personal\\r\\nobservation, can give one so vivid an idea of Life in the Indian\\r\\nvillage and wigwam.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. _Miles Standish_ was the Captain of the Pilgrims. He conducts us in\\r\\nthe May Flower, across the Atlantic, lands us at Plymouth, and tells\\r\\nthe never to be forgotten story of the heroism of our fathers in\\r\\nlaying the foundations of this great republic.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. _Captain Kidd_, and the Buccaneers, reveal to us the awful\\r\\ncondition of North and South America, when there was no protecting law\\r\\nhere, and when pirates swept sea and land, inflicting atrocities, the\\r\\nnarrative of which causes the ear which hears it to tingle.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. _Peter Stuyvesant_ takes us by the hand, and introduces us to the\\r\\nDutch settlement at the mouth of the Hudson, conveys us, in his\\r\\nschooner, up the solitary river, along whose forest-covered banks\\r\\nIndian villages were scattered; and reveals to us all the struggles,\\r\\nby which the Dutch New Amsterdam was converted into the English New\\r\\nYork.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. _Benjamin Franklin_ should chronologically take his place\\r\\nhere. There is probably not, in the compass of all literature, a\\r\\nbiography more full of entertainment and valuable thought, than\\r\\na truthful sketch of the career of Benjamin Franklin. He leads us to\\r\\nPhiladelphia, one hundred and fifty years ago, and makes us perfectly\\r\\nfamiliar with life there and then. He conducts us across the Atlantic\\r\\nto the Court of St. James, and the Court of Versailles. There is no\\r\\nwriter, French or English, who has given such vivid sketches of the\\r\\nscenes which were witnessed there, as came from the pen of Benjamin\\r\\nFranklin. For half a century Franklin moved amid the most stupendous\\r\\nevents, a graphic history of which his pen has recorded.\\r\\n\\r\\n8. _George Washington_ has no superior. Humanity is proud of his name.\\r\\nHe seems to have approached as near perfection as any man who ever\\r\\nlived. In his wonderful career we became familiar with all the\\r\\nstruggles of the American Revolution. With a feeble soldiery,\\r\\ncollected from a population of less than three millions of people, he\\r\\nbaffled all the efforts of the fleets and armies of Great Britain, the\\r\\nmost powerful empire upon this globe.\\r\\n\\r\\n9. _Daniel Boone_ was the Cowper of the wilderness; a solitary man\\r\\nloving the silent companionship of the woods. He leads us across the\\r\\nAlleghanies to the fields of Kentucky, before any white man\\'s foot\\r\\nhad traversed those magnificent realms. No tale of romance could ever\\r\\nsurpass his adventures with the Indians.\\r\\n\\r\\n10. _Kit Carson_ was the child of the wilderness. He was by nature a\\r\\ngentleman, and one of the most lovable of men. His weird-like life\\r\\npassed rapidly away, before the introduction of railroads and\\r\\nsteamboats. His strange, heroic adventures are ever read with\\r\\nastonishment, and they invariably secure for him the respect and\\r\\naffection of all who become familiar with his name.\\r\\n\\r\\n11. _Paul Jones_ was one of the purest patriots, and perhaps the most\\r\\nheroic naval hero, to whom any country has given birth. He has been so\\r\\ntraduced, by the Tory press of Great Britain, that even the Americans\\r\\nhave not yet done him full justice. This narrative of his astonishing\\r\\nachievements will, it is hoped, give him rank, in the opinion of every\\r\\nreader, with Washington, Franklin, Jefferson and Lafayette.\\r\\n\\r\\n12. _David Crockett_ was a unique man. There is no one like him. Under\\r\\nno institutions but ours could such a character be formed. From a log\\r\\nhut, more comfortless than the wigwam of the savage, and without being\\r\\nable either to read or write, he enters legislative halls, takes his\\r\\nseat in Congress, and makes the tour of our great cities, attracting\\r\\ncrowds to hear him speak. His life is a wild romance of undoubted\\r\\ntruth.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch is the character of this little library of twelve volumes. The\\r\\nwriter, who has now entered the evening of life, affectionately\\r\\ncommends them to the young men of America, upon whose footsteps their\\r\\nmorning sun is now rising. The life of each one, if prolonged to three\\r\\nscore years and ten, will surely prove a stormy scene. But it may end\\r\\nin a serene and tranquil evening, ushering in the glories of an\\r\\nimmortal day.\\r\\n\\r\\n                         JOHN S. C. ABBOTT.\\r\\n\\r\\n     FAIR HAVEN, CONN.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs this is not improbably the last book I shall write, it may not be\\r\\nimproper for me to state that, at the age of twenty-four, I commenced\\r\\nthe career of an author, by writing \"The Mother At Home.\" I have now\\r\\nattained the age of three score years and ten. In the meantime I have\\r\\nwritten fifty-four volumes of History or Biography. In every one it\\r\\nhas been my endeavor to make the inhabitants of this sad world more\\r\\nbrotherly,--better and happier.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe long series is probably closed with the biography of Benjamin\\r\\nFranklin. Every page has been penned under this impression. A theme\\r\\nmore full of instruction and interest could not be chosen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now, in my declining years, as I feel that the battle has been\\r\\nfought and, I hope, the victory won, it is an unspeakable comfort for\\r\\nme to reflect, that, in all these fifty-four volumes, there is not one\\r\\nline which, \"dying, I could wish to blot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCONTENTS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n CHAPTER I.\\r\\n\\r\\n _Parentage and Early Life._\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                                  PAGE\\r\\n\\r\\n The parentage of Franklin--His parents emigrate to America--Character\\r\\n of his father--Abiah Folger, his mother--Birth and baptism--Influence\\r\\n of his Uncle Strong--Of the Whistle--Childish exploits--Uncongenial\\r\\n employment--Skill in swimming--Early reading--Boston at that time--An\\r\\n indentured apprentice--Form of Indenture--Enters a printing\\r\\n office--Fondness for reading--Anecdotes--Habits of study--Fondness for\\r\\n argument--Adopts a vegetable diet--The two creeds.                 11\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n CHAPTER II.\\r\\n\\r\\n _Developments of Character._\\r\\n\\r\\n Views of the Sabbath--Writings of Collins and Shaftsbury--The creed\\r\\n of Collins--Franklin at sixteen--The Courant--Denunciations of the\\r\\n paper--Franklin\\'s mode of acquiring the art of composition--His\\r\\n success as a writer--The Editor prosecuted--Benjamin becomes Editor\\r\\n and Publisher--Jealousy of his brother--The runaway apprentice--The\\r\\n voyage to New York--Great disappointment--Eventful Journey to\\r\\n Philadelphia--Gloomy prospects--The dawn of brighter days.         31\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n CHAPTER III.\\r\\n\\r\\n _Excursion to England._\\r\\n\\r\\n Attention to dress--Receives a visit from Gov.

fortune in this\\r\\nnew world. He was in all respects a very worthy man, intelligent,\\r\\nindustrious, and influenced to conduct by high moral and religious\\r\\nprinciples. Several of Josiah Franklin\\'s neighbors accompanied him in\\r\\nhis removal.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoston was then a straggling village, of five or six thousand\\r\\ninhabitants. In front spread out its magnificent bay, with its\\r\\nbeautiful islands. In the rear the primeval forest extended, almost\\r\\nunbroken, through unexplored wilds to the Pacific. His trade was that\\r\\nof a dyer. Finding, however, but little employment in that business,\\r\\nhe set up as a tallow chandler and soap boiler. Four years of life\\'s\\r\\nusual joys and sorrows passed away when Mrs. Franklin died, leaving\\r\\nsix children. The eldest was but eleven years of age. This motherless\\r\\nlittle family needed a maternal guardian. Within the year, Mr.\\r\\nFranklin married Abiah Folger, of Nantucket. She was the youngest\\r\\ndaughter of Peter Folger, a man illustrious for many virtues, and of\\r\\nwhom it has been well said, that \"he was worthy to be the grandfather\\r\\nof Benjamin Franklin.\" She proved to be a noble woman, and was all\\r\\nthat either husband or children could wish for. Ten children were the\\r\\nfruit of this union. Benjamin was born on the sixth of January, (O.\\r\\nS.) 1706.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was born in the morning of a Sabbath day. His father then resided\\r\\ndirectly opposite the Old South Church, in Milk street. The same day,\\r\\nthe babe, whose renown it was then little imagined would subsequently\\r\\nfill the civilized world, was wrapped in blankets, and carried by his\\r\\nfather across the street through the wintry air, to the Old South\\r\\nChurch, where he was baptized by the Rev. Dr. Willard. He was named\\r\\nBenjamin, after a much beloved uncle then residing in England. This\\r\\nuncle was a man of some property, of decided literary tastes, and of\\r\\nthe simple, fervent piety, which characterized the best people of\\r\\nthose days. He took an ever increasing interest in Benjamin. He\\r\\neventually came over to this country, and exerted a powerful influence\\r\\nin moulding the character of his nephew, whose brilliant intellect he\\r\\nappreciated.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after the birth of Benjamin, his father removed to a humble but\\r\\ncomfortable dwelling at the corner of Hanover and Union streets. Here\\r\\nhe passed the remainder of his days. When Franklin had attained the\\r\\nage of five years, a terrible conflagration took place, since known as\\r\\nthe Great Boston Fire. Just as the cold blasts of winter began to\\r\\nsweep the streets, this great calamity occurred. The whole heart of\\r\\nthe thriving little town was laid in ashes. Over a hundred families\\r\\nfound themselves in destitution in the streets.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn incident took place when Franklin was about seven years of age,\\r\\nwhich left so indelible an impression upon his mind, that it cannot be\\r\\nomitted in any faithful record of his life. He gave the following\\r\\naccount of the event in his autobiography, written after the lapse of\\r\\nsixty-six years:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"My friends, on a holiday, filled my pockets with coppers. I\\r\\n     went directly to a shop where they sold toys for children;\\r\\n     and being charmed with the sound of a whistle that I met by\\r\\n     the way in the hands of another boy, I voluntarily gave all\\r\\n     my money for one. I then came home and went whistling all\\r\\n     over the house, much pleased with my whistle, but disturbing\\r\\n     all the family. My brothers and sisters and cousins,\\r\\n     understanding the bargain I had made, told me that I had\\r\\n     given four times as much for it as it was worth; put me in\\r\\n     mind what good things I might have bought with the rest of\\r\\n     the money; and laughed at me so much for my folly, that I\\r\\n     cried with vexation; and the reflection gave me more chagrin\\r\\n     than the whistle gave me pleasure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis story, as published by Franklin, with his keen practical\\r\\nreflections, has become as a household word in all the families of\\r\\nEngland and America; and has been translated into nearly all the\\r\\nlanguages of modern Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom early childhood Franklin was celebrated for his physical beauty,\\r\\nhis athletic vigor and his imperturbable good nature. His companions\\r\\ninvariably recognized him as their natural leader. He was in no\\r\\nrespect what would be called a religious boy, but in many things he\\r\\nhad a high sense of honor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a marsh, flooded at high tides, where the boys used to fish\\r\\nfor minnows. Much trampling had converted the spot into a quagmire. A\\r\\nman was about to build a house near by, and had carted a large\\r\\nquantity of stones for the cellar. Franklin called the boys together\\r\\nand suggested that they should go in the evening, take those stones,\\r\\nand build a wharf upon which they could stand with dry feet. It was\\r\\ndone. And under the skilful engineering of the youthful Franklin, it\\r\\nwas quite scientifically done. Complaints and detection followed.\\r\\nJosiah Franklin severely reproved Benjamin for the dishonest act, but\\r\\nit does not appear that the conscience of the precocious boy was much\\r\\ntroubled. He argued very forcibly that the utility of the measure\\r\\nproved its necessity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the age of eight years, Benjamin entered the Boston Grammar School.\\r\\nHis progress was very rapid, and at the close of the year he was at\\r\\nthe head of his class. The father had hoped to give his promising boy\\r\\na liberal education; but his large family and straitened circumstances\\r\\nrendered it necessary for him to abandon the plan. At the age of ten\\r\\nyears his school life was completed, and he was taken into his\\r\\nfather\\'s shop to run of errands, and to attend to the details of\\r\\ncandle-making, cutting wicks, filling moulds, and waiting upon\\r\\ncustomers. He could write a good hand, could read fluently, could\\r\\nexpress himself with ease on paper, but in all arithmetical studies\\r\\nwas very backward.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is scarcely any sport which has such a charm for boys as\\r\\nswimming. Franklin excelled all his companions. It is reported that\\r\\nhis skill was wonderful; and that at any time between his twelfth and\\r\\nsixtieth year, he could with ease have swum across the Hellespont. In\\r\\nhis earliest years, in all his amusements and employments, his\\r\\ninventive genius was at work in searching out expedients. To\\r\\nfacilitate rapidity in swimming he formed two oval pallets, much\\r\\nresembling those used by painters, about ten inches long, and six\\r\\nbroad. A hole was cut for the thumb and they were bound fast to the\\r\\npalm of the hand. Sandals of a somewhat similar construction were\\r\\nbound to the soles of the feet. With these appliances Franklin found\\r\\nthat he could swim more rapidly, but his wrists soon became greatly\\r\\nfatigued. The sandals also he found of little avail, as in swimming,\\r\\nthe propelling stroke is partly given by the inside of the feet and\\r\\nankles, and not entirely by the soles of the feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the vicinity of Boston there was a pond a mile wide. Franklin made\\r\\na large paper kite, and when the wind blew strongly across the pond,\\r\\nhe raised it, and entering the water and throwing himself upon his\\r\\nback was borne rapidly to the opposite shore. \"The motion,\" he says,\\r\\n\"was exceedingly agreeable.\" A boy carried his clothes around.\\r\\nSubsequently he wrote to M. Dubourg,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I have never since that time practiced this singular mode\\r\\n     of swimming; though I think it not impossible to cross in\\r\\n     this manner from Dover to Calais. The packet boat, however,\\r\\n     is still preferable.\"[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 1: Sparks\\' Life and Works of Franklin, Vol. 6, p. 291.]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe taste for reading of this wonderful boy was insatiable. He had\\r\\naccess, comparatively, to few books, but those he devoured with the\\r\\nutmost eagerness. Bunyan\\'s Pilgrim\\'s Progress was, so to speak, his\\r\\nfirst love. Having read and re-read it until his whole spirit was\\r\\nincorporated with its nature, he sold the volume and purchased\\r\\nBurton\\'s Historical Collections. This consisted of quite a series of\\r\\nanecdotes and adventures, written in an attractive style, and\\r\\npublished at a low price. In those early years he read another book\\r\\nwhich exerted a powerful influence in the formation of his character.\\r\\nWhen eighty years of age he alludes as follows to this work in a\\r\\nletter to Mr. Samuel Mather, who was son of the author, Cotton Mather,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"When I was a boy I met with a book entitled \\'Essays to do\\r\\n     Good,\\' which I think was written by your father. It had\\r\\n     been so little regarded by a former possessor that several\\r\\n     leaves of it were torn out; but the remainder gave me such a\\r\\n     turn of thinking, as to have an influence on my conduct\\r\\n     through life; for I have always set a greater value on the\\r\\n     character of a doer of good, than on any other kind of a\\r\\n     reputation; and if I have been, as you seem to think, a\\r\\n     useful citizen, the public owe the advantage of it to that\\r\\n     book.\"[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 2: This volume has been republished by the Mass. S. S.\\r\\nSociety.]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Franklin was twelve years of age, the population of Boston had\\r\\nincreased to about ten thousand. An incident is recorded of Franklin\\r\\nat this time, which strikingly illustrates the peculiarity of his\\r\\nmental structure and the want of reverence with which he gradually\\r\\naccustomed himself to regard religious things. His father\\'s habit, in\\r\\nthe long graces which preceded each meal, rather wearied the temper of\\r\\nhis son. The precocious young skeptic, with characteristic\\r\\nirreverence, ventured to say,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think, father, that if you were to say grace over the whole cask,\\r\\nonce for all, it would save time.\"[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 3: Works of Dr. Franklin by W. Temple Franklin. Vol. I, p.\\r\\n447.]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the remark of a boy but twelve years of age. Though it does\\r\\nnot indicate a very devout spirit, it certainly gives evidence of an\\r\\nintellect of unusual acuteness.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin ever spoke of his boyhood as the very happy period of a\\r\\nremarkably happy life. His peculiar temperament enabled him to be\\r\\nhappy under circumstances in which others would have been very\\r\\nmiserable. His affections in after years ever yearned toward Boston;\\r\\nhe was accustomed to speak of it as \"that beloved place.\" In one of\\r\\nhis letters to John Lathrop he wrote,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The Boston manner, the turn of phrase, and even tone of\\r\\n     voice and accent in pronunciation, all please and seem to\\r\\n     revive and refresh me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor two years Benjamin continued to assist his father in the business\\r\\nof soap and candle making. He was continually looking for an\\r\\nopportunity to escape the drudgery of that employment and enter upon\\r\\nsome more congenial business. Like most adventurous boys, he thought\\r\\nmuch of the romance of a sea-life. An elder brother had run away, had\\r\\ngone to sea, and for years had not been heard from. Benjamin\\'s father\\r\\nbecame very anxious as he witnessed the discontent of his son. This\\r\\nanxiety was increased when an elder brother married, removed to Rhode\\r\\nIsland, and set up a soap and candle establishment for himself. This\\r\\nseemed to Benjamin to rivet the chains which bound him at home.\\r\\nApparently his father could not spare him from the business. Thus he\\r\\nseemed doomed to spend the remainder of his days in employment which\\r\\nproved to him increasingly uncongenial.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe judicious father, apprehensive that his son might be lured\\r\\nsecretly to embark for some distant voyage, visited with his son all\\r\\nthe varied workshops of Boston, that he might select that trade which\\r\\nto him would seem most desirable. Benjamin examined all these\\r\\nworkshops with intensest interest. He selected the employment of a\\r\\ncutler, and entered upon the business for a few days; but at that time\\r\\na boy who was about to learn a trade was apprenticed to a master. As a\\r\\npremium for learning the business he usually had to pay about one\\r\\nhundred dollars. Then after a series of years, during which he worked\\r\\nfor nothing, he was entitled for a time to receive journeyman\\'s wages.\\r\\nBut his father, Josiah Franklin, was unable to settle satisfactorily\\r\\nthe terms of indenture, and the cutlery trade was given up.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have mentioned that Franklin was one of a large family of children.\\r\\nBy the two marriages of his father, there were sixteen sons and\\r\\ndaughters around the family hearth. One of the sons, James, had been\\r\\nsent to London to learn the trade of a printer. He returned to Boston\\r\\nand set up business on his own account, when Benjamin was eleven\\r\\nyears of age. It was decided to bind Benjamin to this business.\\r\\nReluctantly Benjamin consented to place himself in such subordination\\r\\nto his brother. He was, however, bound to him for a period of nine\\r\\nyears, from twelve to twenty-one. During the last year he was to\\r\\nreceive a journeyman\\'s wages. The following extract from this form of\\r\\nindenture of apprenticeship, which was in common use in the reign of\\r\\nGeorge the First, will be read with interest.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"He shall neither buy nor sell without his master\\'s license.\\r\\n     Taverns, inns, or ale-houses he shall not haunt. At cards,\\r\\n     dice, tables, or any other unlawful game he shall not play.\\r\\n     Matrimony he shall not contract; nor from the service of his\\r\\n     said master day nor night absent himself, but in all things,\\r\\n     as an honest and faithful apprentice, shall and will demean\\r\\n     and behave himself towards his said master and all his,\\r\\n     during said term. And the said James Franklin, the master,\\r\\n     for and in consideration of the sum of ten pounds of lawful\\r\\n     British money to him in hand paid by the said Josiah\\r\\n     Franklin, the father, the receipt of which is hereby\\r\\n     acknowledged, the said apprentice in the art of a printer\\r\\n     which he now useth, shall teach and instruct or cause to be\\r\\n     taught and instructed the best way and manner that he can,\\r\\n     finding and allowing unto the said apprentice, meat, drink,\\r\\n     washing, lodging and all other necessaries during the said\\r\\n     term.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBenjamin devoted himself with great assiduity to learn the trade of a\\r\\nprinter. The office in which he worked, stood at the corner of\\r\\nFranklin avenue and Court street. For three years, Franklin was thus\\r\\nemployed, apparently never seeking recreation, and never having a\\r\\nmoment of leisure save such as he could rescue from sleep or from his\\r\\nmeals. There were at that time several bookstores in Boston. The\\r\\neminent men of that province had brought with them to the New World,\\r\\nliterary and scientific tastes of a high order. Even then the axe of\\r\\nthe settler had been heard but at a short distance in the primeval\\r\\nforests, which still encircled all the large towns. Bears were not\\r\\nunfrequently shot from Long Wharf, as they swam from island to island,\\r\\nor endeavored to cross the solitary bay. It is said that at that time\\r\\ntwenty bears were often shot in a week.\\r\\n\\r\\nBenjamin Franklin, inspired by his love of reading, cultivated\\r\\nfriendly relations with the clerks in the bookstores. From them he\\r\\nborrowed interesting volumes, which he took home in the evening with\\r\\nthe utmost care, and having spent most of the night in reading, would\\r\\nreturn them at an early hour in the morning, before the master of the\\r\\nshop had time to miss them.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething in the demeanor of Franklin attracted the attention of a\\r\\nmerchant in Boston by the name of Matthew Adams. He invited him to his\\r\\nlibrary and loaned him books. The lad\\'s Uncle Benjamin, in England,\\r\\nwho was very fond of composing rhymes which he called poetry, sent\\r\\nmany of his effusions to his favorite nephew, and opened quite a brisk\\r\\ncorrespondence with him. Thus Benjamin soon became a fluent rhymester,\\r\\nand wrote sundry ballads which were sold in the streets and became\\r\\nquite popular. There was a great demand at that time for narratives of\\r\\nthe exploits of pirates, the doom of murderers, and wild love\\r\\nadventures. It is said that one of the Boston publishers, in the sale\\r\\nof ballads alone, found a very lucrative business. Benjamin, who found\\r\\nit very easy to write doggerel verse, wrote one ballad called \"The\\r\\nLight-house Tragedy.\" It was a graphic, and what would be called at the\\r\\npresent day, a sensational account of a shipwreck, in which the\\r\\ncaptain and his two daughters perished. He wrote another which was\\r\\nstill more captivating, and which in all its main features was\\r\\nhistorically true. It was an account of the world-renowned pirate,\\r\\nEdward Teach, usually called Blackbeard. The reader will find a minute\\r\\nnarrative of the career of that monster in the volume of this series\\r\\nof Pioneers and Patriots entitled \"Captain Kidd; or the early American\\r\\nBuccaneers.\" One stanza has descended to us which it is said composed\\r\\na portion of this ballad, and which is certainly a fair specimen of\\r\\nthe popular style then in vogue.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Come all you jolly sailors\\r\\n       You all so stout and brave,\\r\\n     Come hearken and I\\'ll tell you,\\r\\n       What happened on the wave.\\r\\n     Oh \\'tis of that bloody Blackbeard\\r\\n       I\\'m going now for to tell\\r\\n     And as how by gallant Maynard\\r\\n       He soon was sent to Hell.\\r\\n     With a down, down, derry down.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was indeed wretched stuff, as Franklin afterwards admitted; but\\r\\nit is to be remembered he was then but a boy of fifteen. Having\\r\\ncomposed the ballad and set in type and printed it, he was then sent\\r\\nto hawk it through the streets. This was certainly a remarkable\\r\\nachievement for a lad of his years. The eagerness with which both of\\r\\nthe ballads were seized by the public must have greatly gratified the\\r\\nself-esteem of the young writer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAddison was a bungler in talk, but every sentence from his pen was\\r\\nelegant. He once said, \"I carry no loose change in my pocket, but I\\r\\ncan draw for a thousand pounds.\" Burke said of Goldsmith, \"He writes\\r\\nlike an angel, but he talks like poor Poll.\" Franklin was by no means\\r\\na bungler in his speech, but he was not fluent. He hesitated, and was\\r\\nat a loss for words, but whatever he wrote had a wonderful flow of\\r\\nharmony. The right word was always in the right place. Doubtless had\\r\\nhe devoted as much attention to the acquirement of conversational\\r\\nease, as he did to skill in writing, he would have been as successful\\r\\nin the one art as in the other. From early life it was his great\\r\\nambition to be not merely a fine but a forcible writer. He did not\\r\\nseek splendor of diction, but that perspicuity, that transparency of\\r\\nexpression which would convey the thought most directly to the mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn odd volume of the Spectator fell in his way. He was charmed with\\r\\nthe style. Selecting some interesting incident, he would read it with\\r\\nthe closest care; he would then close the book, endeavoring to retain\\r\\nthe thought only without regard to the expression. Then with pen, in\\r\\nhand, he would sit down and relate the anecdote or the incident in the\\r\\nmost forceful and graphic words his vocabulary would afford. This he\\r\\nwould correct and re-correct, minutely attending to the capitals and\\r\\nthe punctuation until he had made it in all respects as perfect as it\\r\\nwas in his power. He then compared his narrative with that in the\\r\\nSpectator. Of course he usually found many faults which he had\\r\\ncommitted, but occasionally he could not but admit he had improved\\r\\nupon his original. This encouraged him with the hope that by long\\r\\ncontinued practice, he might become an able writer of the English\\r\\nlanguage. This practice he continued for months, varying it in many\\r\\nways. He continued to rhyme, though he admitted that there was little\\r\\npoetry in his verse. The exercise, however, he thought useful in\\r\\ngiving him a mastery of language.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Franklin wrote ballads, he seemed to be mainly interested in\\r\\nreading books of the most elevated and instructive character. Locke\\'s\\r\\n\"Essay on the Human Understanding,\" he studied thoroughly. \"The Art of\\r\\nThinking,\" by the Messrs. de Port Royal, engrossed all his energies.\\r\\nBut perhaps there was no book, at that time, which produced so deep\\r\\nand abiding impression on his mind as the \"Memorabilia of Socrates,\"\\r\\nby Xenophon.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin was fond of arguing; he was naturally disputatious. With his\\r\\nkeen intellect, he was pretty sure to come off as victor, at least in\\r\\nhis own judgment, in discussions with his associates. But the Socratic\\r\\nmethod of argumentation, so different from that in which he had been\\r\\naccustomed to indulge, at once secured his approval and admiration.\\r\\nSocrates was never guilty of the discourtesy of assailing an opponent\\r\\nwith flat contradiction or positive assertion. With a politeness which\\r\\nnever failed him, and a modesty of demeanor which won the regard of\\r\\nall others, he would lead his fellow disputant, by a series of\\r\\nquestions, to assent to the views which he advocated. Franklin\\r\\nimmediately commenced practicing upon this newly discovered art. He\\r\\nwas remarkably successful, and became one of the most agreeable and\\r\\nbeloved of companions. But ere long he became satisfied of the folly\\r\\nof these disputations, in which each party struggles, not for\\r\\ntruth, but for victory. It is simply an exercise of intellectual\\r\\ngladiatorship, in which the man who has the most skill and muscle\\r\\ndiscomfits his antagonist. Jefferson warned his nephew to avoid\\r\\ndisputation. He says, \"I have never known, during my long life, any\\r\\npersons\\' engage in a dispute in which they did not separate, each more\\r\\nfirmly convinced than before of the correctness of his own views.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin enjoyed marvellous health. His digestive powers were perfect.\\r\\nHe could live upon any thing and almost upon nothing without\\r\\nexperiencing any inconvenience. A book advocating purely vegetable\\r\\ndiet accidentally fell into his hands. It urged the pecuniary economy\\r\\nand the saving of time in adopting a vegetarian diet. Eagerly he\\r\\nadopted the views presented. He could safely do so, had the author\\r\\nadvocated raw onions and carrots. The stomach of Franklin would have\\r\\nreceived them and assimilated them without any remonstrance. He\\r\\nsucceeded in inducing his brother to relinquish one half of his board\\r\\nand allow him to board himself. Benjamin found that in this way, he\\r\\nsaved much time and much money. A handful of raisins, a roll of bread,\\r\\nand a glass of water afforded him a dinner. This he could dispose of\\r\\nin from five to ten minutes, and have the remainder of the dinner hour\\r\\nfor reading.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hours of the night were his own. He often sat up late and rose\\r\\nearly, his soul all absorbed in intellectual vigils.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two platforms of morality, in some respects inseparably\\r\\nblended, in others quite distinctly separated from each other. The one\\r\\nof these platforms constitutes the low standard of mere worldly\\r\\nmorality. It says,\\r\\n\\r\\n     You must not kill, you must not steal, you must not lie, you\\r\\n     must not slander your neighbor, you must not cheat him in a\\r\\n     bargain.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there is another platform which not only includes all this, but\\r\\nwhich introduces principles of an infinitely higher grade. It is the\\r\\nplatform enforced by Jesus Christ as essential to a life which shall\\r\\nbe pleasing to our Heavenly Father. Our Saviour says, You must love\\r\\nGod in whom you live and move and have your being: you must daily\\r\\npray to him with gratitude for the favors you receive. In the great\\r\\nconflict, raging here below, between sin and holiness, your whole\\r\\nheart must yearn with the desire that God\\'s \"kingdom may come and that\\r\\nHis will may be done on earth as in Heaven.\" Imitating the example of\\r\\nyour Saviour, who was God manifest in the flesh that by His life He\\r\\nmight show men how to live, you must do everything in your power to\\r\\nlead your neighbors and friends to love God, to avoid everything in\\r\\nthought, word, or deed, which you think will be displeasing to Him;\\r\\nand you must do all in your power to prepare your heart for that world\\r\\nof purity and love where the spirits of the just are made perfect. No\\r\\none can be blind to the fact that these principles are infinitely\\r\\nabove the principles of mere worldly morality. They are not a\\r\\nsubstitute for those principles, but an addition to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the age of sixteen, Franklin was disposed to adopt the lower of\\r\\nthese creeds as his rule of life; at times affirming that it was\\r\\nsuperior to the teachings of Jesus Christ; while again there would be\\r\\nthe very clear and inconsistent avowal that, in this wicked world,\\r\\nsomething more was needed than teachings which he could plainly see\\r\\nseldom, if ever influenced a lost and degraded man, to be changed\\r\\nfrom a Saul of Tarsus to a Paul the Apostle. No one can understand the\\r\\npeculiar religious and moral character of Benjamin Franklin, without\\r\\nbearing in mind these distinctions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Developments of Character._\\r\\n\\r\\n     Views of the Sabbath--Writings of Collins and\\r\\n     Shaftsbury--The creed of Collins--Franklin at sixteen--The\\r\\n     Courant--Denunciations of the paper--Franklin\\'s mode of\\r\\n     acquiring the art of composition--His success as a\\r\\n     writer--The Editor prosecuted--Benjamin becomes Editor and\\r\\n     Publisher--Jealousy of his brother--The runaway\\r\\n     apprentice--The voyage to New York--Great\\r\\n     disappointment--Eventful Journey to Philadelphia--Gloomy\\r\\n     prospects--The dawn of brighter days.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin was never scrupulous in the observance of the Sabbath. Still,\\r\\nthough he but occasionally attended church, he at times very earnestly\\r\\nurged that duty upon his young friends. It is not probable that the\\r\\npreaching he heard in those days, was calculated to interest him.\\r\\nWhile a child under the parental roof, he ordinarily accompanied his\\r\\nparents, and seemed to regard it as his duty to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe now, however, with an increasing sense of independence, very much\\r\\npreferred to spend his precious hours in his chamber, reading books\\r\\nwhich engrossed his most intense interest. Unfortunately many\\r\\ntreatises fell into his hands in which unchristian sentiments were\\r\\nconveyed to his mind, by men of the highest intellectual character,\\r\\nand whose writings were invested with the most fascinating charms of\\r\\neloquence.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert Boyle, an Irish nobleman of wealth and fervent piety, had\\r\\nestablished at Oxford a lectureship, the object of which was to prove\\r\\nthe truth of the Christian religion. These lectures had found their\\r\\nway in tracts to the little library of Franklin\\'s father. When but\\r\\nfifteen years of age the boy read them, with a far keener relish than\\r\\nmost school-boys now read the flashy novels of the day. In order to\\r\\nrefute the arguments of the deists, the lecturers were bound to\\r\\nproduce those arguments fairly and forcibly. But to this young boy\\'s\\r\\npiercing mind, the arguments against Christianity seemed stronger than\\r\\nthose which were brought forward to refute them. Thus the lad became,\\r\\nnot a positive unbeliever, but an honest doubter. He now sought\\r\\nearnestly for other works upon that all-important subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two most important, influential and popular writers of that day\\r\\nwere perhaps Anthony Collins and the Earl of Shaftsbury. These were\\r\\nboth men of fortune, of polished education, and of great rhetorical\\r\\nand argumentative skill. Their influence over young minds was greatly\\r\\nincreased by the courtesy and candor which pervaded all their\\r\\nwritings. They ever wrote like gentlemen addressing gentlemen; and\\r\\nthe views they urged were presented with the modesty of men who were\\r\\nearnestly seeking for the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main attack of both of these men was directed against the miracles\\r\\nof the Bible. It was very evident that, the Divine authority of the\\r\\nBible being overthrown, the whole structure of the Christian religion\\r\\nand morality must pass away. Mr. Parton, in his admirable Life of\\r\\nFranklin, says,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Any one who will turn over an edition of Shaftsbury, and\\r\\n     try to read it with the mind of this merry and receptive\\r\\n     printer\\'s boy, will perceive how entirely captivating it\\r\\n     must have been to him. The raillery that was always the\\r\\n     raillery of a gentleman; the irony so delicate as really to\\r\\n     deceive some men who passed for acute; the fine urbanity\\r\\n     that pervades even the passages called severe; the genuine\\r\\n     reverence of the author for virtue; the spectacle revealed\\r\\n     of a man uniting in himself all that is good in sense, with\\r\\n     all that is agreeable in the man of the world,--how pleasing\\r\\n     it must all have been to our inky apprentice as he munched\\r\\n     his noon-day crust.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe practical creed of Collins and Shaftsbury, so far as it can be\\r\\ngleaned from the obscurity of their brilliant pages, consisted in\\r\\nthe entire renunciation of all that is deemed the spirituality of\\r\\nthe Christian creed, and the simple enforcement of the ordinary\\r\\nprinciples of morality in man\\'s intercourse with his brother man. In\\r\\nsubstance they said,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Be truthful and honest. Do not openly oppose the\\r\\n     institutions of Christianity, for that will render you\\r\\n     obnoxious to your neighbors. Conform to the ordinary usages\\r\\n     of the society in the midst of which you move; and as to\\r\\n     creeds, let them alone as unworthy of a moment\\'s thought.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin, at sixteen years of age, became a thorough convert to these\\r\\nviews. He was virtually without any God. He had no rule of life but\\r\\nhis own instincts; but those instincts were of a high order,\\r\\nemboldening his character and restraining him from all vulgar vice.\\r\\nThus he wandered for many years; though there are many indications of\\r\\nan occasionally troubled mind, and though he at times struggled with\\r\\ngreat eagerness to obtain a higher state of moral perfection, he\\r\\ncertainly never developed the character of a warm-hearted and devoted\\r\\nfollower of Jesus.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 4: \"For some years he wandered in heathenish darkness.\\r\\nHe forsook the safe and good though narrow way of his forefathers,\\r\\nand of his father and mother, and his gentle Uncle Benjamin, without\\r\\nfinding better and larger ways of his own. He was in danger of\\r\\nbecoming a castaway or a commonplace successful man of the world.\\r\\nHe found in due time, after many trials, and much suffering and\\r\\nmany grievous errors, that the soul of a man does not thrive\\r\\nupon negations, and that, in very truth a man must _believe_\\r\\nin order that he may be saved.\"--_Parton\\'s Life of Franklin, Vol. I,\\r\\np. 71._]\\r\\n\\r\\nJames Franklin was prosperous in his business. On the 17th of August,\\r\\n1721, he issued the first number of a newspaper entitled \"The New\\r\\nEngland Courant.\" Benjamin set the type, struck off the impression\\r\\nof two or three hundred, with a hand-press, and then traversed\\r\\nthe streets, carrying the diminutive sheet to the homes of the\\r\\nsubscribers. The Courant soon attracted attention. A knot of sparkling\\r\\nwriters began to contribute to its columns, and while the paper was\\r\\nwith increasing eagerness sought for, a clamor was soon raised against\\r\\nit. It was denounced as radical in its political tendencies, and as\\r\\nspeaking contemptuously of the institutions of religion. Cotton\\r\\nMather, even, launched one of his thunderbolts against it. He wrote,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"We find a notorious, scandalous paper called \\'The Courant\\'\\r\\n     full freighted with nonsense, unmanliness, raillery,\\r\\n     profaneness, immorality, arrogance, calumnies, lies,\\r\\n     contradictions and what not, all tending to quarrels and\\r\\n     divisions, and to debauch and corrupt the mind and manners\\r\\n     of New England.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIncrease Mather also denounced the paper, in terms still more\\r\\nemphatic.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this time a strong antipathy was springing up between James, and\\r\\nhis apprentice brother. James assumed the airs of a master, and was\\r\\narrogant and domineering, at times in his anger proceeding even to\\r\\nblows. Benjamin was opinionated, headstrong and very unwilling to\\r\\nyield to another\\'s guidance. As Benjamin compared his own compositions\\r\\nwith those which were sent to the Courant, he was convinced that he\\r\\ncould write as well, if not better, than others. He, therefore, one\\r\\nevening prepared an article, before he was sixteen years of age,\\r\\nwhich, with the greatest care, was written in pure Addisonian diction.\\r\\nDisguising his hand, he slipped this at night under the door of the\\r\\nprinting office. The next morning several contributors were chatting\\r\\ntogether in the editorial office, as Benjamin stood at the printing\\r\\ncase setting his types. The anonymous article was read and freely\\r\\ncommented upon. The young writer was delighted in finding it highly\\r\\ncommended, and in their guesses for the author, the names of the most\\r\\ndistinguished men in Boston were mentioned.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe singular nom de plume he assumed was \"Silence Dogood.\" Over that\\r\\nsignature he wrote many articles before it was ascertained that he was\\r\\nthe author. These articles attracted so much attention that young\\r\\nBenjamin could not refrain from claiming their paternity. This led his\\r\\nbrother and others to regard him with far more respect than\\r\\nheretofore.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Courant, while popular with the masses, became unpopular with\\r\\nthe governmental authorities and with the religious community. As a\\r\\nslap in the face of the government, a fictitious letter was written,\\r\\nprofessedly from Newport, stating that a piratic ship had appeared off\\r\\nthe coast, plundering, burning, and destroying. It was then stated\\r\\nthat the government of Massachusetts was fitting out an armed vessel\\r\\nto attack the pirate, and that, wind and weather permitting, the\\r\\nvessel would sail from Boston sometime during the month.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis reflection upon the dilatoriness of government gave great\\r\\noffence. The members of the Council summoned Franklin before them to\\r\\nanswer for the libel. He admitted that he was the publisher of the\\r\\npaper, but refused to give the name of the writer. The Council decided\\r\\nthat the paragraph was a high affront to the government, and ordered\\r\\nhis imprisonment in the Boston jail. Here he was incarcerated for a\\r\\nweek. Crushed by his misfortunes he wrote a very humble letter stating\\r\\nthat his close confinement endangered his life, and begging that he\\r\\nmight enjoy the liberty of the jail-yard. His request was granted, and\\r\\nfor three weeks more he remained a prisoner, though with daily\\r\\npermission to leave his cell.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this time Benjamin conducted the paper, editing it, setting\\r\\nthe type, printing the sheets and distributing the copies to the\\r\\nsubscribers. He was still but a boy of sixteen. James was eventually\\r\\nreleased from prison, but the general character of the Courant\\r\\nremained unchanged. Unworthy professors of Christianity were\\r\\nincessantly assailed. The virtues of true Christians--of the\\r\\nmultitudes of the disciples of Jesus, who were mothers in Israel, or\\r\\nwho were Israelites indeed in whom there was no guile, were forgotten;\\r\\nwhile every mean and contemptible act of hypocrites and apostates was\\r\\nproclaimed with trumpet resonance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length the Council declared in reference to a peculiarly obnoxious\\r\\ncopy of the paper, that the Courant of that date contained many\\r\\npassages perverting the Holy Scriptures, and slandering the civil\\r\\ngovernment, the ministers, and the good people of the land. A\\r\\ncommittee of three was appointed to report upon the matter. After two\\r\\ndays they brought in the following decision:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"We are humbly of opinion that the tendency of said paper, is\\r\\n     to mock religion and bring it into contempt; that the Holy\\r\\n     Scriptures are therein profanely abused; that the revered and\\r\\n     faithful ministers of the Gospel are ignominiously reflected\\r\\n     on; and that His Majesty\\'s government is affronted; and the\\r\\n     peace and good order of His Majesty\\'s subjects of this\\r\\n     province disturbed by this said Courant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe committee, therefore, proposed that James Franklin should be\\r\\nstrictly forbidden to print or publish the Courant, or any other paper\\r\\nof the like nature, unless it were supervised by the secretary of the\\r\\nprovince.\\r\\n\\r\\nJames Franklin and his friends, after this decision, met in the office\\r\\nof the Courant, and adroitly decided to evade the mandate by canceling\\r\\nthe indentures of apprenticeship of Benjamin, and constituting him the\\r\\neditor and publisher of the journal. This precocious lad prepared his\\r\\ninaugural. It contained the following sentiments:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Long has the press groaned in bringing forth a hateful brood\\r\\n     of pamphlets, malicious scribbles, and billingsgate ribaldry.\\r\\n     No generous and impartial person then can blame the present\\r\\n     undertaking which is designed purely for the diversion and\\r\\n     merriment of the reader. Pieces of pleasantry and mirth have\\r\\n     a secret charm in them to allay the heats and tumults of our\\r\\n     spirits, and to make a man forget his restless resentment.\\r\\n     The main design of this weekly paper will be to entertain the\\r\\n     town with the most comical and diverting incidents of human\\r\\n     life, which in so large a place as Boston will not fail of a\\r\\n     universal exemplification. Nor shall we be wanting to fill up\\r\\n     these papers with a grateful interspersion of more serious\\r\\n     morals which may be drawn from the most ludicrous and odd\\r\\n     parts of life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt cannot be denied that Franklin aimed his keen shafts at many of the\\r\\nbest of men who were consecrating all their energies to the promotion\\r\\nof the physical, moral, and religious welfare of their fellow\\r\\ncreatures. He had a keen eye to search out their frailties; and though\\r\\nhe seldom if ever, dipped his pen in gall, he did at times succeed in\\r\\nmaking them the song of the drunkard, and in turning against them the\\r\\nderision of all the lewd fellows of the baser sort.\\r\\n\\r\\nBenjamin, elated by flattery and success, admits that at seventeen\\r\\nyears of age he became in his treatment of his brother \"saucy and\\r\\nprovoking.\" James was increasingly jealous and exacting. At length a\\r\\nvery violent quarrel arose between them. The elder brother even\\r\\nundertook to chastise his younger brother, whom he still affected to\\r\\nregard as his apprentice. The canceling of the terms of indenture, he\\r\\nregarded as a secret act, intended merely to outwit his opponent.\\r\\nFranklin, burning with indignation, resolved no longer to continue in\\r\\nhis brother\\'s employment, and went to several other printers in\\r\\nBoston, hoping to enter into a new engagement. But his brother had\\r\\npreceded him, giving his own version of the story, and even declaring\\r\\nhis brilliant brother to be an infidel and an atheist.\\r\\n\\r\\nBenjamin resolved to run away; for he still felt the binding\\r\\nobligation of his apprenticeship, while he tried to satisfy his mind\\r\\nthat the unjust conduct of James entitled him to violate the\\r\\nobligation. There was a vessel about to sail for New York. He sold\\r\\nsome of his books to pay his passage; and going on board secretly at\\r\\nnight, he solicited the captain to aid him in concealing him, with the\\r\\n_false_ statement that he had become involved in a love adventure with\\r\\na young girl; that she had subsequently proved to be a bad character;\\r\\nthat her friends insisted on his marrying her; and that his only\\r\\nrefuge was to be found in flight.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis passage to New York was swift and pleasant. It is said that having\\r\\nadopted the vegetarian diet, he doubted our right to deprive an animal\\r\\nof life for our own gratification in eating. The sloop was one day\\r\\nbecalmed off Block Island. The crew found it splendid fishing ground;\\r\\nthe deck was soon covered with cod and haddock. Franklin denounced\\r\\ncatching the fishes, as murderous, as no one could affirm that these\\r\\nfishes, so happy in the water, had ever conferred any injury upon\\r\\ntheir captors. But Benjamin was blessed with a voracious appetite. The\\r\\nfrying pan was busy, and the odor from the fresh fish was exceedingly\\r\\nalluring. As he watched a sailor cutting open a fish, he observed in\\r\\nits stomach a smaller fish, which the cod had evidently eaten.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" he exclaimed, \"if you can eat one another, I surely have a right\\r\\nto eat you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAll his scruples vanished. He sat down with the rest to the sumptuous\\r\\nrepast, and never after seemed to have any hesitancy in gratifying his\\r\\nappetite.\\r\\n\\r\\nBenjamin tells this story in his autobiography, and shrewdly adds,\\r\\nquoting from some one else,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"So convenient a thing it is to be a _reasonable_ creature,\\r\\n     since it enables one to find or make a reason for everything\\r\\n     one has a mind to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was in the beautiful month of October, 1723, when Benjamin landed\\r\\non the wharves of New York. He was not quite eighteen years of age;\\r\\nhad but little money in his purse; and was without any letter of\\r\\nrecommendation or any acquaintance in the town. The place consisted of\\r\\nbut seven or eight thousand inhabitants. The streets were the crooked\\r\\nlanes which we still find in the vicinity of the Battery. Some of the\\r\\nmost important were uncomfortably paved with cobble stones. Most of\\r\\nthe inhabitants were Dutch, reading and speaking only the Dutch\\r\\nlanguage. There was at that time indeed, but little encouragement for\\r\\nan English printer. There was but one bookstore then in New York; and\\r\\nbut one printing office, which was conducted by William Bradford.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe runaway apprentice could find no employment. But William Bradford\\r\\nhad a son in Philadelphia who was also a printer. He said to Benjamin,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He may employ you, as he has recently lost an apprentice by death.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLeaving his chest of clothes to go round by sea to Philadelphia,\\r\\nBenjamin took passage in a small dilapidated shore boat which crept\\r\\nalong the coast to Amboy. A drunken Dutchman was his only fellow\\r\\npassenger. The gloom of the primeval forest overshadowed Governor\\'s\\r\\nIsland: not a single cabin as yet had been reared in its solitudes. A\\r\\nsquall struck the boat, split its sail, and pitched the Dutchman\\r\\noverboard. Franklin caught him by the hair and saved him from\\r\\ndrowning. The sudden tempest increased into a storm, and the boat was\\r\\ndriven fiercely before the gale. The surf dashed so violently upon the\\r\\nshore that they could not venture to land. Night approached.\\r\\nExhausted, drenched and hungry, they cast anchor near the Long Island\\r\\nshore, where a bend in the land afforded them slight protection while\\r\\nstill they were in great danger. There were one or two log cabins in\\r\\nthe vicinity. Several of the men came to the shore, but could afford\\r\\nthem no relief. They had no provision on board excepting a single\\r\\nbottle of bad rum. All night long the tempest beat upon them. In the\\r\\nmorning the wind had so far lulled that they were enabled to repair\\r\\ntheir sail, and to work their way on to Amboy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was late in the afternoon when they reached the port. For thirty\\r\\nhours they had been without food or water. Such were the perils of a\\r\\npassage from New York to Philadelphia in the year 1723.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin, in the enjoyment of magnificent health, slept quietly that\\r\\nnight in an humble inn, and awoke in the morning with all his\\r\\naccustomed vigor. There were still fifty miles of land travel before\\r\\nhim, ere he could cross the forest covered plains of New Jersey to\\r\\nBurlington, on the banks of the Delaware, which were seventeen miles\\r\\nabove Philadelphia. There was neither railroad, stage-coach nor cart\\r\\nto convey him through the wilderness. Indeed it was thirty-three years\\r\\nafter this before the first line of stages across New Jersey was\\r\\nestablished. There was a rude path, probably following an ancient\\r\\nIndian trail, along which our solitary adventurer trudged on foot. It\\r\\nrained; but still Benjamin found it necessary, having so slender a\\r\\npurse, to press on regardless of discomfort.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in the afternoon he came to a hamlet, by the roadside, where he\\r\\nfound himself so exhausted by the unaccustomed toil of walking, and by\\r\\nexposure to the rain and the miry roads, that he felt it necessary to\\r\\nremain until the next morning. The aspect he presented was shabby and\\r\\ndilapidated in the extreme; for he was in his working dress, which by\\r\\nthe wear and tear of travel had become greatly soiled and tattered. He\\r\\nwas not a little mortified to find that the inhabitants of the cabin,\\r\\nwhile they treated him kindly, evidently regarded him with suspicion\\r\\nas a runaway apprentice.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the gloom of that night, poor Benjamin bitterly repented the step\\r\\nhe had taken, and earnestly wished himself back again in the home\\r\\nwhich he had forsaken. Clouds and darkness had gathered around his\\r\\npath and he could see but little bright beyond. Early the next morning\\r\\nhe resumed his travels, pressing vigorously along all day. When the\\r\\nshades of night enveloped him he had reached a point within ten miles\\r\\nof Burlington. He passed the night comfortably in a settler\\'s cabin,\\r\\nand early the next morning pressed on to the little village of\\r\\nBurlington, from which he was informed that a boat started every\\r\\nSaturday, to descend the still silent and almost unfrequented shores\\r\\nof the Delaware to Philadelphia. Much to his disappointment he reached\\r\\nBurlington just after the regular Saturday boat had gone, and was\\r\\ninformed that there was no other boat to leave until the next Tuesday.\\r\\nHe made his united breakfast and dinner upon gingerbread, which he\\r\\nbought in the street of an old woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurlington was on the east side of the river, Philadelphia was on the\\r\\nwest. There was no road between the two places, the communication\\r\\nbeing by the river only. It seemed impossible for Benjamin to toil\\r\\nthat distance through the pathless, tangled forest. He had but five\\r\\nshillings in his pocket. With the utmost economy that would not defray\\r\\nhis expenses at Burlington, for three days, and leave a sufficient sum\\r\\nto pay his passage down the river.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his distress and perplexity, our young philosopher, whose renown\\r\\nfor wisdom subsequently filled all Christian lands, turned back to the\\r\\npoor, aged woman of whom he had bought his gingerbread and solicited\\r\\nher advice. The good old soul, not insensible to the charms of the\\r\\nfrank and manly looking boy, with motherly tenderness insisted on his\\r\\ngoing to her own humble home. Gladly he accepted the invitation. The\\r\\ndinner consisted of what is called ox-cheek; Franklin contributed a\\r\\npot of beer.\\r\\n\\r\\nWalking out early in the evening upon the banks of the river, he\\r\\nfound, to his great joy, a chance boat had come along, bound to\\r\\nPhiladelphia and containing many passengers. Eagerly Franklin joined\\r\\nthem, and bidding adieu to his kind entertainer, was soon drifting\\r\\nslowly down the stream. The night was dark, there was no wind, and no\\r\\ncheerful gleam from the white man\\'s cabin or the Indian\\'s wigwam met\\r\\nthe eye. It was necessary to resort to rowing. At length, a little\\r\\nafter midnight, several of the passengers insisted that they must have\\r\\npassed Philadelphia without seeing it, and refused to row any farther.\\r\\nThey therefore ran the boat into a little creek, built a rousing fire,\\r\\nfor the night was damp and chill, and ranging themselves around its\\r\\ngenial warmth awaited the dawn of the morning. The light revealed to\\r\\nthem Philadelphia but a few miles below them. It was Sunday morning.\\r\\nAt nine o\\'clock the boat was made fast at Market street wharf, and\\r\\nFranklin, with one silver dollar and one shilling in copper coin in\\r\\nhis pocket, stepped on shore. All his copper coin he paid for his\\r\\npassage.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was the introduction of the future Governor of Pennsylvania to\\r\\nthe realm over which he was eventually to preside as Governor, and of\\r\\nwhich he became its most illustrious citizen.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was unquestionably dressed in the peculiar and picturesque costume\\r\\nof the times. He wore knee breeches of buckskin, and a voluminous\\r\\novercoat, lined with pockets of astonishing capacity, which pockets\\r\\nwere crammed with shirts and stockings. A low, battered, broad-brimmed\\r\\nhat covered his clustering ringlets. His coarse woolen stockings\\r\\ndisplayed to advantage the admirably moulded calves of his legs.\\r\\nEvery article of this costume was draggled, shabby, soiled, and much\\r\\nof it tattered.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith an indescribable feeling of loneliness, exhausted with the\\r\\ntoilsome and sleepless night, and with the cravings of hunger, he\\r\\nsauntered up into the town. Coming across a baker\\'s shop, he stepped\\r\\nin, and called for three pennyworth of bread. In Philadelphia, food\\r\\nwas abundant and bread was cheap. To his surprise three long rolls\\r\\nwere given to him. He took one under each arm, and in his hunger the\\r\\nhomeless boy walked along devouring the other. Philadelphia was then a\\r\\nvillage widely spread out, with surrounding vegetable gardens, and\\r\\ncontaining a population of about seven thousand inhabitants.\\r\\n\\r\\nBenjamin walked listlessly along as far as Fourth street. He chanced\\r\\nto pass the house of a Mr. Read, whose very pretty daughter, Deborah,\\r\\nwas standing at the front door. She was eighteen years of age, and was\\r\\nmuch amused at the comical appearance which the young man presented as\\r\\nhe passed by.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not easy to imagine in these days, the state of society in these\\r\\nearly settlements, hewn out from the forests on the river\\'s banks, and\\r\\nwith the unexplored wilderness spreading out to unimagined regions\\r\\nin the interior. At night, even from the houses of the village, the\\r\\nhowling of the wolves could be heard as they rushed after their prey.\\r\\nBears and deers were shot in abundance. And Indian bands, painted and\\r\\nplumed, were ever swarming through the streets.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin walked along, devouring his rolls, and returned to the river\\r\\nfor a drink of water. Such was his first breakfast in Philadelphia. In\\r\\nthe boat was a poor woman with her child. Franklin gave to her the two\\r\\nremaining rolls, which he could not conveniently carry about with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot knowing what to do, and led by curiosity to explore the town, he\\r\\nreturned to Market street, then one of the chief avenues of the city.\\r\\nIt was a little after ten o\\'clock in the morning. The street was\\r\\ncrowded with well-dressed people, pressing along to church. There was\\r\\none important edifice called the \"Great Meeting House\" of the Quakers.\\r\\nIt stood at the corner of Second and Market streets.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin joined the crowd, and took his seat with the vast assembly.\\r\\nHe soon fell soundly asleep. The hour passed away. The congregation\\r\\ndispersed, and Benjamin was left still asleep. Some one then kindly\\r\\nawoke the tired traveler, and he again stepped out into the streets so\\r\\nlonely, where there was not an individual whom he knew, and where\\r\\nalmost without money he could find no refuge which he could call a\\r\\nhome.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he walked toward the river, he met a young Quaker whose countenance\\r\\npleased him. Of him he inquired where he could find a respectable and\\r\\ncomfortable lodging. The friendly Quaker led him to a tavern, near\\r\\nChestnut street, called the \"Crooked Billet.\" Franklin ordered a\\r\\nfrugal dinner, threw himself upon the bed, and slept till supper time,\\r\\nand immediately after supper went to bed and slept soundly till the\\r\\nmorning.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had now been from home eleven days. His money was nearly expended.\\r\\nHis clothes were worn; and almost the only hope remaining was the very\\r\\nvisionary one that Mr. Bradford\\'s son might possibly have some\\r\\nemployment for him. Early in the morning he carefully brushed his\\r\\ntravel-worn clothes, his shoes, his hat, and making himself as\\r\\nrespectable in appearance as possible, went to the house of the\\r\\nprinter, Andrew Bradford. To his surprise and gratification he found\\r\\nthe father there, who had just arrived, having traveled from New York\\r\\nto Philadelphia on horseback.\\r\\n\\r\\nBenjamin met with a courteous reception, was invited to breakfast. He\\r\\nwas, however, greatly disappointed in being informed that Andrew\\r\\nBradford had just engaged another apprentice to take the place of the\\r\\none who was lost. Mr. Bradford, however, stated that there was a man,\\r\\nby the name of Keimer, who had recently commenced the printing\\r\\nbusiness in the town, and might have employment for him. The old\\r\\ngentleman kindly offered to go to the office with Benjamin, and\\r\\nintroduce him to Keimer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey found Keimer a very eccentric looking individual, in a small\\r\\noffice, with an old dilapidated press, and with a few worn-out types.\\r\\nHe asked the young man a few questions, put a composing stick into his\\r\\nhands, and professed himself satisfied with his work. He then told\\r\\nFranklin that he could find no work for him immediately, but he\\r\\nthought ere long he could employ him. It seems, however, that at once\\r\\nBenjamin went to work, repairing the dilapidated old press, while he\\r\\ncontinued to board at Mr. Bradford\\'s, paying for his board by the work\\r\\nwhich he performed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Excursion to England._\\r\\n\\r\\n     Attention to dress--Receives a visit from Gov. Keith--His\\r\\n     visit to Boston--Collins returns to Philadelphia with\\r\\n     him--Sir William Keith\\'s aid--Excursions on the\\r\\n     Sabbath--Difficulty with Collins--Spending Mr. Vernon\\'s\\r\\n     money--His three friends--Engagement with Deborah\\r\\n     Read--Voyage to England--Keith\\'s deceit--Ralph--Franklin\\r\\n     enters a printing house in London.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eccentric Keimer soon found that Franklin was a workman whose\\r\\nservices would be invaluable to him. He had no home of his own, but\\r\\nbecame very unwilling that Benjamin, while in his employ, should board\\r\\nin the family of a rival printer. He therefore made arrangements for\\r\\nhim to board at Mr. Read\\'s, whose pretty daughter, Deborah, had made\\r\\nherself merry but a few days before in view of his uncouth appearance.\\r\\n\\r\\nFortunately for the young man, who was never regardless of the\\r\\nadvantages of a genteel dress, his chest had arrived bringing his\\r\\nclothing. He was thus able to present himself before the young lady in\\r\\nattractive costume. And his address was always that of an accomplished\\r\\ngentleman. As we have mentioned, he was ever in his youth, middle\\r\\nlife, and old age, remarkable for his personal beauty.\\r\\n\\r\\nBright and sunny days now dawned upon Franklin. His employer\\r\\nappreciated his varied and wonderful merits. He received good wages.\\r\\nThe family in which he resided was highly attractive, and he there\\r\\nfound a home congenial with his pure and refined tastes. Several\\r\\nmonths passed away before he heard from the friends he had left in\\r\\nBoston. The tyranny of his brother had so greatly offended him, that\\r\\nfor a time he endeavored to exclude from his mind all thoughts of his\\r\\nhome. He heard, however, that one of his sisters had married Captain\\r\\nRobert Holmes, the captain of a vessel sailing between Boston and the\\r\\nports on the Delaware.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn those piratical days, when the master of a ship was compelled to\\r\\nsail with guns loaded to the muzzle, and with sharpened sabres, he was\\r\\ndeemed a personage of great importance. No weak or ordinary man could\\r\\ndischarge the responsibilities of such a post. Captain Holmes,\\r\\ninfluenced by the love of his wife, wrote to Benjamin informing him of\\r\\nthe grief his departure had caused the family, entreating him to\\r\\nreturn, and assuring him that all the past should be forgotten.\\r\\n\\r\\nBenjamin, in his reply, wrote with such precision and force of logic,\\r\\nthat Captain Holmes became satisfied that he was by no means so much\\r\\nin the wrong as he had supposed. It so chanced that when the captain\\r\\nreceived this letter, he was in company with Sir William Keith, then\\r\\nthe Governor of Pennsylvania. He read the letter to the Governor. Sir\\r\\nWilliam was charmed with its literary and rhetorical ability; and\\r\\ncould scarcely believe that the writer was but eighteen years of age.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Philadelphia printers,\" said he, \"are wretched ones. Keimer is a\\r\\ncompound of fool and rogue. But this young man is manifestly of great\\r\\npromise and ought to be encouraged.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day Benjamin and his master were working together, when they saw\\r\\ntwo well-dressed gentlemen approaching. They proved to be the Governor\\r\\nof Pennsylvania, Sir William Keith, and Franklin\\'s brother-in-law,\\r\\nCaptain Holmes, whom he probably had never before seen. Keimer ran\\r\\ndown stairs to meet them, supposing, of course, that he must be the\\r\\nman who was entitled to the honor of their visit. To his surprise they\\r\\ninquired for his apprentice, and went up the stairs to the printing\\r\\noffice to see him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBenjamin was quite overwhelmed by the honors with which he was\\r\\ngreeted. The Governor paid him many compliments, expressed an earnest\\r\\ndesire to make his acquaintance, and politely censured him for\\r\\nnot calling at the gubernatorial mansion upon his arrival in\\r\\nPhiladelphia. The interview was terminated by taking Franklin with\\r\\nthem to a neighboring tavern to dine. There the three met upon\\r\\napparently perfect social equality, and very freely discussed many\\r\\nimportant matters as they drank their wine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Governor, a very plausible, unreliable man, ever lavish of\\r\\npromises without performance, proposed that Franklin, aided by funds\\r\\nfrom his father, should open a printing office for himself. He\\r\\npromised to exert his influence to secure for his young protegÃ© the\\r\\npublic printing of both the provinces of Pennsylvania and Delaware.\\r\\nWhen Franklin suggested that he feared his father would be either\\r\\nunable or unwilling to furnish the needed funds, the Governor promised\\r\\nto write to him with his own hand, explaining the advantages of the\\r\\nscheme.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the protracted interview, it was decided that Benjamin should\\r\\nreturn to Boston by the first vessel. He was to take with him Sir\\r\\nWilliam\\'s letter, and thus aided, endeavor to win over his father to\\r\\ntheir plans.\\r\\n\\r\\nA week or two elapsed before there was a vessel ready to sail for\\r\\nBoston. At that time the social rank of a printer was decidedly above\\r\\nthat of other mechanic arts. There was something sacred attached to\\r\\nthe employment, and it was regarded as near akin to the learned\\r\\nprofessions. Franklin was frequently invited to dine with the\\r\\nGovernor. His perfect self-possession, his careful dress and polished\\r\\naddress, united with his wonderful conversational powers, rendered him\\r\\na great favorite with all the distinguished guests whom he was\\r\\naccustomed to meet at the table of the Governor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter part of April, 1724, Franklin, then eighteen years of age,\\r\\ntook passage in a small vessel for Boston. His friends in Philadelphia\\r\\ngenerally understood that he was going home merely to visit his\\r\\nfriends. It was deemed expedient to throw the veil of great secrecy\\r\\nover the enterprise in which he was contemplating to engage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe voyage was exceedingly tempestuous. The vessel sprang a leak. For\\r\\nsome time passengers and crew worked at the pumps night and day. But\\r\\nafter being buffeted by winds and waves for fourteen dreary days, the\\r\\nlittle vessel cast anchor in the harbor of Boston. Franklin had then\\r\\nbeen absent from home seven months.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis sudden appearance was a great surprise to all the members of the\\r\\nnumerous family. It is not surprising that the young man, elated by\\r\\nhis brilliant prospects, assumed rather lordly airs. His dress was new\\r\\nand quite elegant. He had purchased a handsome watch, which he was not\\r\\nreluctant to display. He had in his pocket twenty-five dollars of\\r\\nsilver coin.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin\\'s brother James, from whom he had run away, was greatly\\r\\nannoyed by the airs of superiority assumed by his old apprentice. With\\r\\na cold and almost scornful eye, he scanned his person from head to\\r\\nfoot, scarcely offering his hand in greeting, and soon coldly and\\r\\nsilently returned to his work. But the imperial young man was not thus\\r\\nto be put down. His former acquaintances gathered eagerly around him\\r\\nand listened with intensest interest to the narrative of his\\r\\nadventures. In glowing terms, Benjamin described his new home in\\r\\nPhiladelphia, drew out from his pocket handfuls of silver which he\\r\\nexhibited to them, and with quite lordly dignity gave his former\\r\\nfellow-journeymen money to go to the ale-house for a treat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe candid reader will make some allowances for the conduct of\\r\\nBenjamin, when he remembers that but a few months before, he had run\\r\\naway to escape the cudgel of his brother. He will also feel inclined\\r\\nto make some allowance for James, when informed that he was in\\r\\nadversity, and struggling severely with pecuniary embarrassment. The\\r\\nCourant, deprived of the graphic pen of Franklin, was rapidly losing\\r\\nits subscribers, and soon became extinct.\\r\\n\\r\\nBenjamin\\'s father Josiah, who needed in his own business every dollar\\r\\nof the funds he could raise, silently and almost without remark, read\\r\\nthe letter of Sir William Keith, and listened attentively to the\\r\\nglowing descriptions of his son. Soon after Captain Holmes arrived.\\r\\nThe judicious father conversed fully with him, and expressed his\\r\\nopinion that Sir William Keith must be a man of but little discretion\\r\\nto think of setting up independently, in very responsible business, a\\r\\nyoung man of but eighteen years of age.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Captain Holmes earnestly advocated the views of the Governor,\\r\\nJosiah Franklin, after mature deliberation, decisively declined\\r\\nfurnishing the necessary funds.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Benjamin,\" said he, \"is too young to undertake an enterprise so\\r\\nimportant. I am much gratified that he has been able to secure the\\r\\napprobation of the Governor of Pennsylvania, and that by his industry\\r\\nand fidelity he has been able to attain prosperity so remarkable. If\\r\\nhe will return to Philadelphia and work diligently until he is\\r\\ntwenty-one, carefully laying up his surplus earnings, I will then do\\r\\neverything in my power to aid him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cautious Christian father then gave his son some very salutary\\r\\nadvice. He entreated him to be more careful in throwing out his arrows\\r\\nof satire, and to cease presenting, in the aspect of the ridiculous,\\r\\nso many subjects which religious men regarded with veneration. He\\r\\nwrote a very courteous letter to Sir William Keith, thanking him for\\r\\nhis kindness to his son, and stating his reasons for declining the\\r\\nproposed aid. Indeed, Josiah Franklin was intellectually, morally, and\\r\\nin all sound judgment, immeasurably the superior of the fickle and\\r\\nshallow royal Governor.\\r\\n\\r\\nSixty years after this visit of Franklin to his paternal home, he\\r\\nwrote a letter to the son of the Rev. Cotton Mather, from which we\\r\\nmake the following pleasing extract:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The last time I saw your father was in the beginning of\\r\\n     1724, when I visited him after my first trip to Pennsylvania.\\r\\n     He received me in his library; and on my taking leave showed\\r\\n     me a shorter way out of the house through a narrow passage\\r\\n     which was crossed by a beam overhead. We were still talking\\r\\n     as I withdrew, he accompanying me behind, and I, turning\\r\\n     partly toward him, when he said hastily, _stoop, stoop!_ I\\r\\n     did not understand him till I felt my head hit against the\\r\\n     beam. He was a man that never missed any occasion of giving\\r\\n     instruction; and upon this he said to me \\'You are young and\\r\\n     have the world before you. Stoop as you go through it, and\\r\\n     you will miss many hard thumps.\\' This advice, thus beat into\\r\\n     my head, has frequently been of use to me. And I often think\\r\\n     of it when I see pride mortified and misfortunes brought\\r\\n     upon people by their carrying their heads too high.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was in Boston a young man by the name of Collins, a reckless,\\r\\ndissipated spendthrift, of very considerable personal attractions. He\\r\\nhad been quite an intimate friend of Franklin; and was so pleased with\\r\\nhis descriptions of Philadelphia that he decided to remove there. This\\r\\nproved one of the calamities of Franklin\\'s life.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin eventually embarked, in a sloop, for his return. It touched\\r\\nat Newport. His brother John lived there, pursuing the trade of a\\r\\ncandle-maker. Benjamin was received by him with great cordiality. At\\r\\nNewport, among the other passengers, two young girls were taken on\\r\\nboard for New York. They were showy, voluble, gaudily dressed. All\\r\\ntheir arts were exerted to secure intimate association with Franklin.\\r\\n\\r\\nA venerable Quaker lady on board called the inexperienced young man\\r\\naside, and with motherly tenderness warned him against their wiles.\\r\\nThough he doubted the necessity of this caution, he was put upon his\\r\\nguard. When the girls left at New York, he declined their pressing\\r\\ninvitation for him to visit them at their home, and he learned from\\r\\nthe captain that they had undoubtedly stolen from him a silver spoon,\\r\\nan article then not often seen in common life, and highly prized.\\r\\nThey were charged with the crime, convicted, and it is said that they\\r\\nwere publicly whipped in the market place.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon Franklin\\'s arrival at New York, Collins, the playmate of his\\r\\nchildhood, was one of the first to meet him. In his earlier days he\\r\\nhad been sober, industrious, and was highly esteemed for his mental\\r\\npowers and attainments. But he had become intemperate and a gambler,\\r\\nand was every day intoxicated. Reduced almost to beggary, Franklin\\r\\nfelt compelled to furnish him with money to save him from starvation.\\r\\nPenniless he had come on board the boat at New York, and Franklin paid\\r\\nhis passage to Philadelphia.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam Burnett was then Governor of New York. He was very fond of\\r\\nbooks and had collected a large library. Franklin also had the same\\r\\ntaste and had a large number of books which he was conveying to\\r\\nPhiladelphia. The captain informed the Governor that he had a young\\r\\nman on board fond of books, and of superior literary attainments. The\\r\\nGovernor begged the captain to bring young Franklin to see him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I waited upon him,\" wrote Franklin, \"and would have taken Collins\\r\\nwith me had he been sober. The Governor received me with great\\r\\ncivility; and we had a good deal of conversation relative to books\\r\\nand authors. This was the second Governor who had done me the honor to\\r\\ntake notice of me, and to a poor boy like me it was very pleasing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon reaching Philadelphia, Franklin presented the letter of his\\r\\nfather to Sir William Keith. The Governor, upon reading the letter,\\r\\nsaid,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your father is too prudent. There is a great difference in persons.\\r\\nDiscretion does not always accompany years; nor is youth always\\r\\nwithout it. But since he will not set you up, I will do it myself.\\r\\nGive me an inventory of the things necessary to be had from England,\\r\\nand I will send for them. You shall repay me when you are able. I am\\r\\nresolved to have a good printer here and I am sure you must succeed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin supposed of course, that he could rely upon the word of the\\r\\nGovernor. He drew up an inventory of goods to the amount of about five\\r\\nhundred dollars. The strange Governor, who found it very easy to talk,\\r\\nran his eye over the list and as if money were a consideration of no\\r\\nmoment to him, and suggested that Franklin should go to London in\\r\\nperson. Greatly elated at this idea, young Franklin eagerly embraced\\r\\nit, and the Governor directed him to be ready to embark in the London\\r\\nHope, a ship which sailed regularly between London and Philadelphia,\\r\\nleaving each port once a year.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral months would elapse before the ship would sail. Sir William\\r\\nenjoined it upon Franklin to keep their plans in the utmost secrecy.\\r\\nConsequently, Franklin continued to work for Keimer, not giving him\\r\\nthe slightest intimation that measures were in progress for the\\r\\nestablishment in Philadelphia, of a printing house which would\\r\\nentirely overshadow his own. This secrecy which was practiced also\\r\\nprevented any one from informing Franklin of the Governor\\'s real\\r\\ncharacter, as a vain, unreliable, gasconading boaster.\\r\\n\\r\\nSix months passed away. They were with Franklin happy months.\\r\\nHe was in perfect health, greatly enjoyed his own physical and\\r\\nintellectual attributes, was much caressed, and was engaged in\\r\\nlucrative employment. He was highly convivial in his tastes, very\\r\\nfond of social pleasures, of the wine cup and of the song: and on\\r\\nSundays in particular, the enchanting forests of the Schuylkill\\r\\nresounded with the songs and the shouts of the merry bacchanals,\\r\\nled by Franklin, who was ever recognized as their chief.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere probably never was a young man more skillful than Benjamin\\r\\nFranklin in plucking the rose and avoiding the thorn. In all his\\r\\nfestivities he was the thoughtful philosopher. Never did he drink to\\r\\nexcess; no money was squandered at the gaming table. Carefully he\\r\\navoided all views which he deemed vulgar and degrading; and he made it\\r\\nthe general rule of his life, to avoid everything which would bring\\r\\npain to his body, or remorse to his soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill man is born to mourn. Even Franklin could not escape the general\\r\\nlot. The drunken Collins became his constant scourge. Franklin felt\\r\\nconstrained to lend his old friend money. He had been entrusted by a\\r\\nfamily friend, a Mr. Vernon, to collect a debt of about fifty dollars.\\r\\nThis money he was to retain till called for. But to meet his own\\r\\nexpenses and those of his spendthrift companion, he began to draw\\r\\nupon it, until it all disappeared. He was then troubled with the\\r\\napprehension that the money might be demanded. Bitter were the\\r\\nquarrels which arose between him and John Collins. His standard of\\r\\nmorality which was perhaps not less elevated than that which the\\r\\nmajority of imperfect professing Christians practice, was certainly\\r\\nbelow that which the religion of Jesus Christ enjoins. Had he been a\\r\\ntrue Christian according to the doctrines and precepts of Jesus, he\\r\\nwould have escaped these accumulating sorrows.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis breaking in upon his friend Vernon\\'s money, and spending it,\\r\\nhe pronounces in his autobiography, to have been the _first great\\r\\nerror_ of his life. Though it so chanced that the money was not\\r\\nrequired until Franklin was able to pay it, yet for several months\\r\\nhe was in the endurance of intense mental anxiety and constant\\r\\nself-reproach.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length, Collins and Franklin became so antagonistic to each other\\r\\nas to proceed to violence. They were on a pleasure party in a boat\\r\\ndown the river. Collins, as usual, was intoxicated. The wrath of the\\r\\nmuscular Benjamin was so aroused, by some act of abuse, that he seized\\r\\nthe fellow by the collar and pitched him overboard. Collins was a good\\r\\nswimmer. They therefore kept him in the water till he was nearly\\r\\ndrowned. When pretty thoroughly humbled, and upon his most solemn\\r\\npromise of good behavior, he was again taken on board. Seldom after\\r\\nthis was a word exchanged between them. Collins, deeply indebted to\\r\\nFranklin, accepted of some business offer at Barbadoes. He sailed for\\r\\nthat island, and was never heard of more.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost every young man has a few particular friends. The three most\\r\\nintimate companions of Benjamin Franklin were young men of his own\\r\\nrank and age, of very dissimilar characters, but having a common taste\\r\\nfor business. They were all clerks. One of these, Joseph Watson, was,\\r\\naccording to Franklin\\'s description, \"a pious, sensible young man of\\r\\ngreat integrity.\" It would seem that they were all persons of very\\r\\nestimable character, though some of them had imbibed Franklin\\'s\\r\\nskeptical opinions. They spent many of their Sabbaths, wandering on\\r\\nthe banks of the romantic Schuylkill, reading to each other their\\r\\ncompositions in prose and verse.\\r\\n\\r\\nJames Ralph, who was very emphatic in his deistical views, in his\\r\\nenthusiasm, decided to devote himself to the art of rhyming. The\\r\\nsensible Franklin tried to dissuade him from his folly, but in vain.\\r\\nOn one occasion they all agreed to attempt a version of the Eighteenth\\r\\nPsalm. This sublime production of an inspired pen contains, in fifty\\r\\nverses, imagery as grand and sentiments as beautiful, as perhaps can\\r\\nanywhere else be found, within the same compass, in any language. It\\r\\ncertainly speaks well for the intellectual acumen of these young men,\\r\\nand for their devotional instincts, that they should have selected so\\r\\nnoble a theme. As their main object was to improve themselves in the\\r\\ncommand of language, and in the power of expression, they could not\\r\\nhave chosen a subject more appropriate, than the Psalmist\\'s\\r\\ndescription of the descent of God to earth.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"He bowed the heavens also and came down; and darkness was under\\r\\n        his feet.\\r\\n     And He rode upon a cherub and did fly;\\r\\n     Yea he did fly upon the wings of the wind.\\r\\n     He made darkness his secret place.\\r\\n     His pavilion round about him were dark waters, thick clouds of\\r\\n        the skies.\\r\\n     At the brightness which was before him his thick clouds passed.\\r\\n     Hail stones and coals of fire.\"[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 5: The intelligent reader will recall the glowing version of\\r\\nthis Psalm, by Steinhold.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The Lord descended from above,\\r\\n       And bowed the heavens most high;\\r\\n     And underneath his feet he cast\\r\\n       The darkness of the sky.\\r\\n     On cherub and on cherubim,\\r\\n       Full royally he rode;\\r\\n     And on the wings of mighty winds,\\r\\n       Came flying all abroad.\"]\\r\\n\\r\\nJoseph Watson died quite young, in the arms of Franklin. Charles\\r\\nOsborne acquired money and reputation, as a lawyer. Removing to the\\r\\nWest Indies, he died, in the prime of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin and Osborne entered into the agreement, which has so often\\r\\nbeen made, that whichever should first die, should, if possible,\\r\\nreturn to the other and reveal to him the secrets of the spirit land.\\r\\nIt is hardly necessary to say that Franklin watched long in vain, for\\r\\na visit from his departed companion.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo months before Franklin sailed for London, Mr. Read, with whom he\\r\\nboarded, died. With the father, mother, and very pretty and amiable\\r\\ndaughter, Deborah, Franklin had found a happy home. A strong affection\\r\\napparently sprang up between the two young people. She was seventeen\\r\\nyears of age, and Franklin eighteen. Their union would be eminently\\r\\nfitting, as in fortune and position in society, they were on the same\\r\\nlevel.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin, enjoying the patronage of the governor, and with, as he\\r\\nsupposed, very brilliant prospects before him, entered into an\\r\\nengagement with Deborah, and was anxious to be married before he\\r\\nembarked for England, designing to leave his young bride at home with\\r\\nher mother. But Mrs. Read, in consideration of their youth, urged that\\r\\nthe nuptials should be postponed until after his return.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir William Keith continued to invite Franklin to his house, and\\r\\nlavished commendation and promises upon him. Still he continually\\r\\npostponed giving him any letters of credit with which he could\\r\\npurchase types, paper and press. Though, as the hour for sailing\\r\\napproached, Franklin called again and again to obtain the needful\\r\\ndocuments, he was continually met with apologies. At length, the day\\r\\nfor the ship to weigh anchor arrived. It was about the 5th of\\r\\nNovember, 1724.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that late hour the private secretary of the Governor called\\r\\nupon Franklin and informed him that Sir William would meet him at\\r\\nNewcastle, where the vessel was to cast anchor, and would then and\\r\\nthere, deliver to him all the important documents. Franklin went on\\r\\nboard. The ship dropped down the broad and beautiful Delaware,\\r\\nwhose banks were brilliant with foliage in their richest autumnal\\r\\nbrilliance, about thirty-two miles below Philadelphia, to Newcastle.\\r\\nTo the great disappointment of Franklin, the Governor still did not\\r\\nappear. He however sent his secretary, with a profusion of excuses,\\r\\nand professing to be pressed with business of the utmost importance,\\r\\npromised to send the letters to the captain before the vessel would be\\r\\npermitted to sail.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin, naturally buoyant and hopeful, did not even then, consider\\r\\nit possible that the Governor was intending to deceive him. Neither\\r\\nwas it possible to conceive of any motive which would induce Sir\\r\\nWilliam to betray him by so deceptive a game. At length a bag from the\\r\\nGovernor, apparently filled with letters and dispatches, was brought\\r\\non board, and again the vessel unfurled her sails. Franklin, with some\\r\\nsolicitude, asked for those which were directed to him. But Captain\\r\\nAnnis, all engrossed with the cares of embarkation, said that he was\\r\\ntoo busy to examine the bag at that time, but that they would, at\\r\\ntheir leisure, on the voyage select the letters.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 10th of November, 1724, the good ship, the London Hope, pushed\\r\\nout from the Delaware upon the broad Atlantic. We know not whether\\r\\nFranklin was surprised to find on board, as one of the passengers, his\\r\\npoetical deistical friend James Ralph. This young man, who had\\r\\nrenounced Christianity, in the adoption of principles, which he\\r\\nprofessed to believe conducive to the formation of a much higher moral\\r\\ncharacter, had deliberately abandoned his wife and child to seek\\r\\nhis fortune in London. He had deceived them by the most false\\r\\nrepresentation. Carefully he concealed from Franklin, his unprincipled\\r\\nconduct and visionary schemes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe voyage was long and rough, as the vessel did not reach London\\r\\nuntil the twenty-fourth of November. On the passage he very carefully,\\r\\nwith the captain, examined the letter-bag. But no letter was found\\r\\naddressed to him. There were several, however, addressed to other\\r\\npersons, with Franklin\\'s name upon the envelope as if they were in his\\r\\ncare. As one of these was addressed to the king\\'s printer and another\\r\\nto a stationer in London, the sanguine young man through all the\\r\\ndreary and protracted voyage, clung to the hope that all was right.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon arriving in London, Franklin hastened first to the stationer\\'s\\r\\nand presented him with the letter, saying to him, \"Here is a letter\\r\\nfrom Governor Keith, of Pennsylvania.\" The stationer looked up with\\r\\nsurprise and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Governor Keith! I do not know of any such person.\" Then breaking the\\r\\nseal, and looking at the signature, he said very contemptuously,\\r\\n\"Riddlesden. I have lately found him to be a complete rascal. I will\\r\\nhave nothing to do with him, nor receive any letters from him.\"[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 6: We both of us happen to know, as well as the stationer,\\r\\nthat Riddlesden, the attorney, was a very knave. He had half ruined\\r\\nMiss Read\\'s father by persuading him to be bound for him. By\\r\\nhis letter it appeared there was a secret scheme on foot to the\\r\\nprejudice of Mr. Hamilton; that Keith was concerned in it with\\r\\nRiddlesden.--Works of Franklin, by Sparks, Vol. i, p. 55.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSo saying he thrust the letter back into Franklin\\'s hand, and turned\\r\\naway to serve a customer. Franklin was almost stunned with this\\r\\nintelligence. He immediately conferred with a Mr. Denham, a judicious\\r\\nfriend whose acquaintance he had made on board the ship. They\\r\\nascertained that the infamous Governor, from motives which it is\\r\\ndifficult to comprehend, had not furnished Franklin with a single\\r\\ndocument. There was not a bill of credit or a single letter of\\r\\nintroduction, commending the young adventurer to people in London.\\r\\nDenham then told him that no one who knew Keith had the slightest\\r\\nconfidence in his promises. That the idea that he would furnish him\\r\\nwith any letters of credit was preposterous, since Sir William had no\\r\\ncredit with any body.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thus Franklin found himself with his companion James Ralph, alone\\r\\nin the great world of London, without any letters of introduction,\\r\\nwithout any prospect of employment, and almost without money. The\\r\\nvirtues of Franklin had exerted a restraining influence upon the\\r\\nunprincipled Ralph, and Franklin had not as yet become acquainted with\\r\\nthe true basis of his character. The two young men met together to\\r\\nconsult in this dilemma and to examine their finances. It appeared\\r\\nthat Ralph had scarcely one penny in his pocket. He had intended to be\\r\\na hanger-on upon Franklin, in whose ability to take care of himself\\r\\nand others he had the greatest confidence. Franklin\\'s purse contained\\r\\nabout fifty dollars.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain he returned to consult with Mr. Denham. He very wisely advised\\r\\nFranklin to seek employment in some of the printing offices in London.\\r\\nHe encouraged him with the thought that thus with a few months\\' labor,\\r\\nhe might not only pay his expenses, but also lay up a sufficient sum\\r\\nto defray his passage home.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin gradually perceived to his dismay, what an old man of the sea\\r\\nhe had got upon his shoulders in the person of James Ralph. The\\r\\nfollowing is his calm comment upon the atrocious conduct of Keith:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What shall we think,\" he writes, \"of a governor playing such pitiful\\r\\ntricks, and imposing so grossly upon a poor ignorant boy? It was a\\r\\nhabit he had acquired; he wished to please every body, and having\\r\\nlittle to give, he gave expectations. He was otherwise an ingenuous,\\r\\nsensible man, a pretty good writer, and a good governor for the\\r\\npeople, though not for his constituents the proprietaries. Several of\\r\\nour best laws were of his planning, and passed during his\\r\\nadministration.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entire absence of anger in this statement, has won for Franklin\\r\\ngreat commendation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith his dependent protegÃ© Ralph, he took humble lodgings in Little\\r\\nBritain street. Ralph had remarkable powers of conversation, with much\\r\\nmore than ordinary literary talent, and could, whenever he wished,\\r\\nmake himself very agreeable and almost fascinating as a companion. But\\r\\nhe was quite a child as to all ability to take care of himself.\\r\\nFranklin really loved him at that time. He was a very handsome young\\r\\nman, graceful in his demeanor; and those who listened to his eloquent\\r\\nharangues would imagine that he was destined to attain to greatness.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin immediately applied for work at the great printing\\r\\nestablishment of Palmer in Bartholomew Close. Fifty journeymen\\r\\nwere here employed. He promptly entered into a contract with the\\r\\nproprieter for the remuneration of about six dollars a week. Ralph,\\r\\ncharacteristically hurried to the theatre to enter upon the profession\\r\\nof a play-actor. Being disappointed in that attempt, his next plan was\\r\\nto edit a newspaper to be called the Spectator. Not being able to find\\r\\na publisher, he then went the rounds of the law offices, in search of\\r\\ncopying, but not even this, could he obtain. In the meantime they were\\r\\nboth supported by the purse of Franklin. With fifty dollars in his\\r\\npocket, and earning six dollars a week, he felt quite easy in his\\r\\ncircumstances, and was quite generous in his expenditure for their\\r\\nmutual enjoyment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Mental and Moral Conflicts._\\r\\n\\r\\n     Faithfulness to work--Neglect of Deborah Read--Treatise on\\r\\n     Liberty and Necessity--Skill in swimming--Return to\\r\\n     America--Marriage of Miss Read--Severe sickness--Death of\\r\\n     Mr. Denham--Returns to Keimer\\'s employ--The Junto--His\\r\\n     Epitaph--Reformation of his treatise on Liberty and\\r\\n     Necessity--Franklin\\'s creed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin and Ralph were essentially congenial in their tastes. Neither\\r\\nof them were religiously inclined in the ordinary acceptation of those\\r\\nwords. But the thoughtful philosophy of Franklin has by many been\\r\\nregarded as the development of an instinctively religious character.\\r\\nThey were both exceedingly fond of amusement and especially of\\r\\npleasure excursions on the Sabbath. Very seldom, did either the\\r\\nintellect or the heart lure them to listen to such teachings as they\\r\\nwould hear from the pulpit. It certainly would have been better for\\r\\nthem both, had they been church-going young men. There was no pulpit\\r\\nin all London from which they would not hear the reiterated counsel,\\r\\nCease to do evil; learn to do well.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin was faithful in the highest degree to his employer.\\r\\nWeary with the day\\'s toil, which with his active mind was highly\\r\\nintellectual as well as mechanical, he almost invariably in the\\r\\nevening sought recreation with Ralph in the theatre. It is safe to\\r\\ninfer that the best productions of our best dramatists, were those\\r\\nwhich would most interest the mind of our young philosopher. Ralph was\\r\\ndaily gaining an increasing influence over his mind. It is said that\\r\\nwe are prone to love more ardently those upon whom we confer favors\\r\\nthan those from whom we receive them.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo these two young men the pleasures of London seemed inexhaustible.\\r\\nFranklin began to forget his old home and his friends. He began to\\r\\nthink that London was a very pleasant place of residence, and that it\\r\\nwas doubtful whether he should ever return to America again. He had\\r\\nconstant employment, the prospect of an increasing income, and with\\r\\nhis economical habits he had ample funds to relieve himself from all\\r\\npecuniary embarrassment. With his friend Ralph, he was leading a very\\r\\njovial life, free from all care.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis love for Deborah Read began to vanish away. He thought very\\r\\nseldom of her: seldom could he find time to write to her; and ere\\r\\nlong his letters ceased altogether; and she was cruelly left to the\\r\\nuncertainty of whether he was alive or dead. Ralph had entirely\\r\\nforgotten his wife and child, and Franklin had equally forgotten his\\r\\naffianced. In subsequent years the memory of this desertion seems to\\r\\nhave weighed heavily on him. He wrote in his advanced life in\\r\\nreference to his treatment of Deborah,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"This was another of the great errors of my life; which I\\r\\n     could wish to correct were I to live it over again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor nearly a year, Franklin thus continued in the employment of Mr.\\r\\nPalmer, receiving good wages and spending them freely. A very highly\\r\\nesteemed clergyman of the Church of England named Wollaston, had\\r\\nwritten a book entitled, \"The Religion of Nature Delineated.\" It was a\\r\\nwork which obtained much celebrity in those days and was published by\\r\\nMr. Palmer. It was of the general character of Butler\\'s Analogy, and\\r\\nwas intended to prove that the morality enjoined by Jesus Christ, was\\r\\nfounded in the very nature of man; and that the principles of that\\r\\nmorality were immutable, even though deists should succeed in\\r\\ndestroying the public faith in the divine authority of Christianity.\\r\\nIt was eminently an amiable book, written with great charity and\\r\\ncandor, and without any dogmatic assumptions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt chanced to fall to Franklin to set up the type. As was customary\\r\\nwith him, he made himself thoroughly acquainted with the treatise of\\r\\nwhich he thus became the compositor. His mind was in such a state in\\r\\nreference to the claims of that Christianity which certainly did not\\r\\ncommend the mode of life he was living, that it excited not only\\r\\nantagonistic but even angry emotions. So thoroughly were his feelings\\r\\naroused, that he wrote and published a pamphlet of thirty-two pages,\\r\\nin refutation of the theory of Mr. Wollaston.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin dedicated his work, which was entitled \"A dissertation\\r\\non Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure and Pain,\" to James Ralph.\\r\\nFortunately, the treatise has descended to us unmutilated. He\\r\\ncommences with the observation:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I have here given you my present thoughts upon the general\\r\\n     state of things in the universe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe production was certainly a very able one to come from the pen of a\\r\\nyoung printer of but nineteen years. Mr. Palmer, while recognizing its\\r\\nability, pronounced its principles to be atrocious and demoralizing.\\r\\nThe production of such a work, literary, philosophical and religious,\\r\\nby probably the youngest companion of the journeymen printers, caused\\r\\nthem all to open their eyes with astonishment, and he was regarded at\\r\\nonce as a great man among them.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 7: In this extraordinary document our young deist writes,\\r\\n\"There is said to be a first mover, who is called God, who is all\\r\\nwise, all good, all powerful. If he is all good, whatsoever he doeth\\r\\nmust be good. If he is all wise, whatever he doeth must be wise. That\\r\\nthere are things to which we give the name of _Evil_, is not to be\\r\\ndenied--such as theft, murder, etc. But these are not in reality\\r\\nevils. To suppose anything to exist or to be done contrary to the will\\r\\nof the Almighty is to suppose him not Almighty. There is nothing done\\r\\nbut God either does or permits. Though a creature may do many actions,\\r\\nwhich, by his fellow creatures, will be named evil, yet he can not act\\r\\nwhat will be in itself displeasing to God.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We will sum up the argument thus, When the Creator first designed the\\r\\nuniverse, either it was his will that all should exist and be in the\\r\\nmanner they are at this time, or it was his will that they should be\\r\\notherwise. To say it was His will things should be otherwise, is to\\r\\nsay that somewhat hath contradicted His will; which is impossible.\\r\\nTherefore we must allow that all things exist now in a manner\\r\\nagreeable to His will; and, in consequence of that, all are equally\\r\\ngood and therefore equally esteemed by Him. No condition of life or\\r\\nbeing is better or preferable to another.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis whole treatise may be found in the appendix to the first volume\\r\\nof Parton\\'s Life of Franklin.]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe deists of London, who had united in a club of merry\\r\\nfree-thinkers, holding their meetings at an ale-house, sought out\\r\\nFranklin and drew him into their convivial gatherings. These men had\\r\\nno common principle of belief; they were united only in the negative\\r\\nprinciple of unbelief in the Christian religion. Ralph had formed a\\r\\nconnection with a young milliner, by whom, through his many\\r\\nfascinations, he was mainly supported.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin, with his increasing expenditures, was now disposed to\\r\\nshake off Ralph, as he needed all his money for his own convivial\\r\\nenjoyments. Ralph went into the country and opened a school, where he\\r\\nutterly failed. The unhappy milliner, ruined in character, and with a\\r\\nlittle child, wrote to Franklin imploring aid. Her letters touched his\\r\\nkindly heart. He could never see sorrow without wishing to relieve it.\\r\\nHe furnished her with money, in small sums, to the amount of one\\r\\nhundred and thirty dollars; and worst of all, we regret to say that he\\r\\ncommenced treating her with such familiarity, that she, still faithful\\r\\nto Ralph, repulsed him indignantly.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 8: Franklin writes in his autobiography, \"I grew fond of her\\r\\ncompany, and being at that time under no religious restraint, and\\r\\ntaking advantage of my importance to her, I attempted to take some\\r\\nliberties with her, another _erratum_, which she repulsed with a\\r\\nproper degree of resentment. She wrote to Ralph and acquainted him\\r\\nwith my conduct. This occasioned a breach between us; and when he\\r\\nreturned to London, he let me know he considered all the obligations\\r\\nhe had been under to me as annulled.\"--Works of Franklin, Vol. i, p.\\r\\n59.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin does not conceal these _foibles_, as he regarded them, these\\r\\n_sins_ as Christianity pronounces them. He declares this simply to\\r\\nhave been another of the great errors of his youth. She informed Ralph\\r\\nof his conduct. He was enraged, broke off all further communication\\r\\nwith Franklin, and thirty-five years passed away before they met\\r\\nagain. Ralph, goaded to desperation, gained a wretched living in\\r\\nvarious literary adventures; writing for any body, on any side, and\\r\\nfor any price. Indeed he eventually gained quite an ephemeral\\r\\nreputation. He could express himself with vivacity, and several quite\\r\\nprominent politicians sought the aid of his pen.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin, thus relieved from the support of Ralph, soon after entered\\r\\na more extensive printing house, at Lincoln\\'s Inn Fields. Though he\\r\\nwas exceedingly fond of a sparkling glass of wine in his convivial\\r\\nhours, he was too much of a philosopher to stupefy his brain in\\r\\nguzzling beer. His habitual daily beverage was cold water.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"My companion at the press,\" he wrote, \"drank every day a\\r\\n     pint before breakfast, a pint at breakfast with his bread and\\r\\n     cheese, a pint between breakfast and dinner, a pint at\\r\\n     dinner, and another when he had done his day\\'s work. I\\r\\n     thought it a detestable custom. But it was necessary, he\\r\\n     supposed, to drink strong beer that he might be strong to\\r\\n     labor. I endeavored to convince him that the bodily strength\\r\\n     afforded by beer could only be in proportion to the grain or\\r\\n     the barley dissolved in the water of which it was made; that\\r\\n     there was more flour in a pennyworth of bread, and,\\r\\n     therefore, if he could eat that with a pint of water, it\\r\\n     would give him more strength than a quart of beer. He drank\\r\\n     on, however, and had four or five shillings to pay, out of\\r\\n     his wages, every Saturday night, for that vile liquor; an\\r\\n     expense I was free from; and thus these poor devils keep\\r\\n     themselves always under.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain Franklin wrote in characteristic phrase, in reference to the\\r\\ninfluence of his example over some of his companions,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"From my example, a great many of them left their muddling\\r\\n     breakfast of bread, beer and cheese, finding they could,\\r\\n     with me, be supplied from a neighboring house, with a large\\r\\n     porringer of hot water gruel, sprinkled with pepper,\\r\\n     crumbled with bread and a bit of butter in it, for the price\\r\\n     of a pint of beer,--three half-pence. This was a more\\r\\n     comfortable, as well as a cheaper breakfast, and kept their\\r\\n     heads clearer. Those who continued sotting with their beer\\r\\n     all day, were often, by not paying, out of credit at the\\r\\n     ale-house; and used to make interest with me to get beer;\\r\\n     their _light_ as they phrased it being out. I watched the\\r\\n     pay table on Saturday night, and collected what I stood\\r\\n     engaged for them, having to pay sometimes on their account.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin\\'s skill in swimming, as we have mentioned was very\\r\\nremarkable. At one time he swam from London to Chelsea, a distance of\\r\\nfour miles. Several of his companions he taught to swim in two\\r\\nlessons. His celebrity was such that he was urged to open a swimming\\r\\nschool.[9] The life of self-indulgence he was now living in London,\\r\\nwas not such as even his loose religious principles could approve. He\\r\\nhad abandoned the faith of his fathers, and had adopted, for his rule\\r\\nof conduct, the principle, that it was right to yield to any\\r\\nindulgences to which his passions incited him. He became tired of\\r\\nLondon, and probably found it necessary to break away from the\\r\\ninfluences and associates with which he had surrounded himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 9: \"On one of these days I was, to my surprise, sent for by\\r\\na great man I knew only by name, Sir William Wyndham. He had heard of\\r\\nmy swimming from Chelsea to Blackfriars and of my teaching Wygate and\\r\\nanother young man to swim in a few hours. He had two sons about to set\\r\\nout on their travels. He wished to have them first taught swimming,\\r\\nand proposed to gratify me handsomely if I would teach them. They were\\r\\nnot yet come to town, and my stay was uncertain, so I could not\\r\\nundertake it. But from the incident I thought it likely that if I were\\r\\nto remain in England and opened a swimming-school I might get a good\\r\\ndeal of money. And it struck me so strongly that had the overture been\\r\\nmade me sooner, probably I should not so soon have returned to\\r\\nAmerica.\"--Autobiography, Vol. I. p. 66.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Denham, his companion of voyage, had decided to return to\\r\\nPhiladelphia, and open an extensive store. He offered Franklin two\\r\\nhundred and fifty dollars a year as book-keeper. Though this was less\\r\\nthan the sum Franklin was then earning, as compositor, there were\\r\\nprospects of his advancement. This consideration, in addition to his\\r\\ndesire to escape from London, led him to accept the offer. He was now\\r\\ntwenty years of age. It does not appear that he had thus far formed\\r\\nany deliberate plan for his life\\'s work. He floated along as the\\r\\ncurrent of events drifted him.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the twenty-first of July, 1726, Franklin embarked on board the ship\\r\\nBerkshire for Philadelphia. He had been absent from America but little\\r\\nmore than a year and a half. During this time he had not increased his\\r\\nfortune, for he had spent his money as fast as he had earned it. After\\r\\na voyage of eighty days, the ship cast anchor before Philadelphia. At\\r\\nthat time ships were often from three to seven months effecting the\\r\\npassage across the Atlantic.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs usual Franklin kept a diary punctually during his long voyage. Its\\r\\npages were replete with pithy remarks of wit and wisdom. He was very\\r\\nfond of a game of checkers, and in that amusement beguiled many weary\\r\\nhours. We find the following striking comments upon the diversion in\\r\\nhis journal:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"It is a game I much delight in. But it requires a clear head\\r\\n     and undisturbed. The persons playing, if they would play\\r\\n     well, ought not much to regard the _consequences_ of the\\r\\n     game; for that diverts and withdraws the mind from the game\\r\\n     itself, and makes the player liable to make many false, open\\r\\n     moves. I will venture to lay it down for an infallible rule\\r\\n     that if two persons equal in judgment, play for a\\r\\n     considerable sum, he that loves money most, shall lose. His\\r\\n     anxiety for the success of the game confounds him. Courage is\\r\\n     almost as requisite for the good conduct of this game as in a\\r\\n     real battle; for if the player imagines himself opposed by\\r\\n     one that is much his superior in skill, his mind is so intent\\r\\n     on the defensive part, that an advantage passes unobserved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Governor of the Isle of Wight had died, leaving the reputation\\r\\nof having been one of the most consummate scoundrels who ever\\r\\nexercised despotic power. Franklin, in his treatise upon \"Liberty and\\r\\nNecessity,\" written but a few months before, had assumed that there\\r\\nwas no such thing as good and evil; that God ordered and controlled\\r\\nevery event; and that consequently every event was in accordance with\\r\\nHis will, and alike pleasing in His sight. But now we find the\\r\\nfollowing record in his journal, which most readers will recognize as\\r\\ninconsistent with the young philosopher\\'s theological opinions. He\\r\\nwrites:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"At the death of this governor, it appeared that he was a\\r\\n     great villain, and a great politician. There was no crime so\\r\\n     damnable, which he would stick at in the execution of his\\r\\n     designs. And yet he had the art of covering all so thick,\\r\\n     that with almost all men in general, while he lived he passed\\r\\n     for a saint. In short, I believe it is impossible for a man,\\r\\n     though he has all the cunning of a devil, to live and die a\\r\\n     villain, and yet conceal it so well as to carry the name of\\r\\n     an honest fellow to the grave with him, but some one by some\\r\\n     accident or other, shall discover him. Truth and sincerity\\r\\n     have a certain distinguishing, native lustre about them,\\r\\n     which cannot be perfectly counterfeited. They are like fire\\r\\n     and flame that cannot be painted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe should infer, from some intimations in Franklin\\'s diary, that he\\r\\nwas troubled by some qualms of conscience, in view of his abandonment\\r\\nof Miss Read, and his irregular life in London. He has left a paper in\\r\\nwhich he stated that he had never formed any regular plan for the\\r\\ncontrol of his conduct: that he was now about to enter on a new life;\\r\\nand that he was resolved that henceforth he would speak the truth, be\\r\\nindustrious in his business, and speak ill of no man. These were\\r\\nrather meagre resolutions for a young man under these circumstances to\\r\\nadopt.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after landing at Philadelphia, Franklin chanced to meet Sir\\r\\nWilliam Keith in the streets. The governor seemed much embarrassed,\\r\\nand passed by without speaking. It does not appear that the\\r\\nacquaintance was ever resumed. The governor lived nearly twenty-five\\r\\nyears afterward, a dishonored and ruined man, and died in the extreme\\r\\nof poverty.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Miss Read, heart-broken, and deeming herself forever abandoned,\\r\\nyielded to the importunities of her friends and married a mechanic by\\r\\nthe name of Rogers. He proved to be a thoroughly worthless fellow. His\\r\\nunconcealed profligacy, and unfaithfulness to his wife, compelled her,\\r\\nafter a few months of wretchedness, to return to her mother, and to\\r\\nresume her maiden name. The profligate husband fled from his creditors\\r\\nto the West Indies. Rumors soon reached Philadelphia of his death,\\r\\nleaving probably another wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin entered upon his duties as clerk of Mr. Denham, with his\\r\\naccustomed energy and skill. He carried into his new vocation, all his\\r\\nintellectual sagacity, and speedily won not only the confidence but\\r\\nthe affection of his employer. He lived with Mr. Denham, and being\\r\\nalways disposed to look upon the bright side of everything, even of\\r\\nhis own imperfections, notwithstanding his infidelity to Miss Read, he\\r\\nseems to have been a very happy and even jovial young man.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour months after Franklin had entered upon his mercantile career,\\r\\nboth Mr. Denham and Franklin were seized with the pleurisy. Mr. Denham\\r\\ndied. Franklin, though brought near to the grave, recovered. He\\r\\nwrites:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I suffered a great deal; gave up the point in my own mind;\\r\\n     and was at the time rather disappointed when I found myself\\r\\n     recovering; regretting in some degree that I must now,\\r\\n     sometime or other, have all that disagreeable work to do over\\r\\n     again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe death of Mr. Denham broke up the establishment, and Franklin was\\r\\nthrown out of employment. Keimer, in whose service he had formerly\\r\\nbeen engaged, again made him an offer to superintend a printing\\r\\noffice. Franklin accepted the proposition. There were five inefficient\\r\\nhands, whom Franklin was expected to transform into accomplished\\r\\nprinters. With these, and a few others, he organized a literary club,\\r\\ncalled the \"Junto; or the Leathern Apron Club,\" as nearly every member\\r\\nwas a mechanic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe club met every Friday evening, and the wine cup, to stimulate\\r\\nconviviality, passed freely among them. There were twenty-four\\r\\nquestions, which were every evening read, to which answers were to be\\r\\nreturned by any one who could answer them. Between each question, it\\r\\nwas expected that each member would fill, and empty, his glass. One\\r\\nwould think that the wine must have been very weak, or the heads of\\r\\nthese young men very strong, to enable them to quaff twenty-four\\r\\nglasses unharmed. We give a few of the questions as specimens of their\\r\\ngeneral character.\\r\\n\\r\\n     1. \"Have you met with anything in the author you last read?\\r\\n\\r\\n     3. \"Has any citizen in your knowledge failed, and have you\\r\\n     heard the cause?\\r\\n\\r\\n     7. \"What unhappy effects of intemperance have you lately\\r\\n     observed?\\r\\n\\r\\n     12. \"Has any deserving stranger arrived in town since your\\r\\n     last meeting?\\r\\n\\r\\n     16. \"Has anybody attacked your reputation lately?\\r\\n\\r\\n     23. \"Is there any difficulty which you would gladly have\\r\\n     discussed at this time?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDebates, declamation, and the reading of essays added to the\\r\\nentertainment of these gatherings. Stories were told, and bacchanal\\r\\nsongs sung. No man could tell a better story, and few men could sing a\\r\\nbetter song than Benjamin Franklin. No one was deemed a suitable\\r\\nmember of the club, who would not contribute his full quota to the\\r\\nentertainment or instruction. The questions proposed by Franklin for\\r\\ndiscussion, developed the elevated intellectual region his thoughts\\r\\nwere accustomed to range. We give a few as specimens.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Can any one particular form of government suit all mankind?\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Should it be the aim of philosophy to eradicate the\\r\\n     passions?\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Is perfection attainable in this life?\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"What general conduct of life is most suitable for men in\\r\\n     such circumstances as most of the members of the Junto are?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Junto was limited to twelve members. It soon became so popular\\r\\nthat applications for admission became very frequent. Six months\\r\\npassed rapidly away, when Keimer, who was an exceedingly immoral and\\r\\nworthless man, and was fast going to ruin, in some fit of drunkenness,\\r\\nor ungovernable irritation, entered the office, and assailed Franklin\\r\\nwith such abuse, that he took his hat, and repaired to his lodgings,\\r\\nresolved never to return.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin was twenty-one years of age. He had laid up no money. He was\\r\\nstill but a journeyman printer. The draft which he had received from\\r\\nMr. Vernon for fifty dollars had not yet been paid. He was exceedingly\\r\\nmortified when he allowed himself to reflect upon this delinquency\\r\\nwhich certainly approached dishonesty. In this emergence he conferred\\r\\nwith a fellow journeyman by the name of Hugh Meredith, whose father\\r\\nwas a gentleman of considerable property. Meredith proposed that they\\r\\nshould enter into partnership, he furnishing the funds, and Franklin\\r\\nthe business capacity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that time Franklin, remembering his narrow escape from the grave\\r\\nby the pleurisy, wrote his own epitaph which has been greatly\\r\\ncelebrated. It has generally been admired; but some of more sensitive\\r\\nminds perceive in it a tone which is somewhat repulsive.\\r\\n\\r\\n                      \"The Body\\r\\n                          of\\r\\n                  BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,\\r\\n                       _Printer_,\\r\\n            (Like the cover of an old book,\\r\\n                 Its contents torn out,\\r\\n        And stripped of its lettering and gilding,)\\r\\n               Lies here, food for worms.\\r\\n          Yet the work itself shall not be lost,\\r\\n     For it will, as he believed, appear once more,\\r\\n                         In a new\\r\\n                 And more beautiful edition,\\r\\n                  Corrected and amended\\r\\n                            By\\r\\n                       THE AUTHOR.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe excellencies of Franklin did not run in the line of exquisite\\r\\nsensibilities. At the early age of fifteen he began to cast off the\\r\\nrestraints of the religion of his father and mother. Nearly all his\\r\\nassociates were what were called Free-thinkers. He could not be blind\\r\\nto their moral imperfections. Mr. Parton writes,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"His old friend Collins, he remembered, was a Free-thinker,\\r\\n     and Collins had gone astray. Ralph was a Free-thinker, and\\r\\n     Ralph was a great sinner. Keith was a Free-thinker, and\\r\\n     Keith was the greatest liar in Pennsylvania. Benjamin\\r\\n     Franklin was a Free-thinker, and how shamefully he had\\r\\n     behaved to Ralph\\'s mistress, to Mr. Vernon and Miss Read,\\r\\n     whose young life had been blighted through him.\"[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 10: Parton\\'s Life of Franklin, Vol. I, p. 168.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin\\'s creed thus far, consisted only of negations. He had no\\r\\nbelief; he had only unbelief. Indeed he seems to have become quite\\r\\nashamed of his treatise upon Liberty and Necessity, published in\\r\\nLondon, and felt constrained to write a refutation of it.[11] As this\\r\\nstrange young man in his discontent looked over the religions of\\r\\nthe world, he could find no one that met his views. He therefore\\r\\ndeliberately and thoughtfully sat down to form a religion of his own.\\r\\nMany such persons have appeared in the lapse of the ages, and almost\\r\\ninvariably they have announced their creeds with the words, \"Thus\\r\\nsaith the Lord.\" But our young printer of twenty-two years, made no\\r\\nprofession whatever, of any divine aid. He simply said, \"Thus saith my\\r\\nthoughts.\" One would think he could not have much confidence in those\\r\\nthoughts, when it is remembered that at this time he was writing a\\r\\nrefutation of the opinions, which he had published in London but a few\\r\\nmonths before.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 11: \"My arguments perverted some others, especially Collins\\r\\nand Ralph. But each of these having wronged me greatly without the\\r\\nleast compunction; and recollecting Keith\\'s conduct towards me, who\\r\\nwas another Free-thinker, and my own towards Vernon and Miss Read,\\r\\nwhich at times gave me great trouble, I began to suspect that this\\r\\ndoctrine, though it might be true, was not very useful. My London\\r\\npamphlet, printed in 1725, and which had for its motto,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"\\'Whatever is is right,\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nand which from the attributes of God, His infinite wisdom, goodness\\r\\nand power, concluded that nothing could possibly be wrong in the\\r\\nworld, and that vice and virtue were empty distinctions, no such\\r\\nthings existing, appeared now not so clever a performance, as I once\\r\\nthought it; and I doubted whether some error had not insinuated itself\\r\\nunperceived into my argument.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the year 1779, Dr. Franklin wrote to Dr. Benjamin Vaughn respecting\\r\\nthis pamphlet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There were only one hundred copies printed, of which I gave a few to\\r\\nfriends. Afterwards, disliking the piece, I burnt the rest, except one\\r\\ncopy. I was not nineteen years of age when it was written. In 1730, I\\r\\nwrote a piece on the other side of the question, which began with\\r\\nlaying for its foundation that almost all men, in all ages and\\r\\ncountries, have at times made use of prayer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thence I reasoned that if all things are ordained, prayer must be\\r\\namong the rest ordained; but as prayer can procure no change in things\\r\\nthat are ordained, praying must then be useless and an absurdity. God\\r\\nwould, therefore, not ordain praying if everything else was ordained.\\r\\nBut praying exists, therefore all other things are not ordained. This\\r\\nmanuscript was never printed. The great uncertainty I found in\\r\\nmetaphysical reasoning disgusted me, and I quitted that kind of\\r\\nreading and study for others more satisfactory.\"--Autobiography, p.\\r\\n76.]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe book which Franklin thus prepared was entitled \"Articles of\\r\\nBelief, and Acts of Religion.\" His simple creed was that there was one\\r\\nSupreme God who had created many minor gods; that the supreme God was\\r\\nso great that he did not desire the worship of man but was far above\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe minor gods are perhaps immortal, and perhaps after the ages lapse\\r\\nthey are changed, others supplying their place. Each of these\\r\\nsubordinate gods has created for himself a sun with its planetary\\r\\nsystem, over which he presides and from the inhabitants of which he\\r\\nexpects adoration. He writes,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"It is that particular wise and good God, who is the author\\r\\n     and owner of our system that I propose for the object of my\\r\\n     praise and adoration. It is to be inferred that this God is\\r\\n     not above caring for us, is pleased with our praise, and\\r\\n     offended when we slight him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then prepares an invocation to this god of our solar system. It is\\r\\nfounded on the style of the Psalms, but is immeasurably inferior to\\r\\nmost of those sublime utterances of the Psalmist of Israel. And still\\r\\nthe sentiments breathed were ennobling in their character; they proved\\r\\nthat Franklin was vastly superior to the thoughtless, reckless deists\\r\\nwho surrounded him, and that his soul was reaching forth and yearning\\r\\nfor higher and holier attainments. In this invocation, the whole of\\r\\nwhich we cannot quote, he writes,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"O Creator! O Father! I believe that thou art good; and that\\r\\n     thou art pleased with the pleasure of thy children. Praised\\r\\n     be thy name forever. By thy power thou hast made the\\r\\n     glorious sun with his attending worlds. By thy wisdom thou\\r\\n     hast formed all things. Thy wisdom, thy power, and thy\\r\\n     goodness are everywhere clearly seen. Thou abhorrest in thy\\r\\n     creatures treachery and deceit, malice, revenge,\\r\\n     intemperance, and every other hurtful vice. But thou art a\\r\\n     lover of justice and sincerity, of friendship and\\r\\n     benevolence, and every virtue. Thou art my friend, my\\r\\n     father, and my benefactor. Praised be thy name; O God,\\r\\n     forever. Amen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prayer which followed, doubtless giving utterance to his most\\r\\ninward feelings, is beautiful.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Inasmuch,\" he wrote, \"as by reason of our ignorance, we\\r\\n     cannot be certain that many things, which we often hear\\r\\n     mentioned in the petitions of men to the Deity, would prove\\r\\n     real goods if they were in our possession, and as I have\\r\\n     reason to hope and believe that the goodness of my Heavenly\\r\\n     Father will not withhold from me a suitable share of temporal\\r\\n     blessings, if by a virtuous and holy life I conciliate his\\r\\n     favor and kindness; therefore I presume not to ask such\\r\\n     things; but rather humbly and with a sincere heart, express\\r\\n     my earnest desire that he would graciously assist my\\r\\n     continual endeavors and resolutions of eschewing vice and\\r\\n     embracing virtue, which kind of supplication will at the same\\r\\n     time remind me in a solemn manner of my extensive duty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then added the supplication that he might be preserved from\\r\\natheism, impiety and profaneness; that he might be loyal to his\\r\\nprince; that he might be gracious to those below him; that he might\\r\\nrefrain from calumny and detraction; that he might be sincere in\\r\\nfriendship, just in his dealings, grateful to his benefactors, patient\\r\\nin affliction; that he might have tenderness for the weak, and that,\\r\\nrejoicing in the good of others, he might become truly virtuous and\\r\\nmagnanimous.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is very evident that some unexplained circumstances had called the\\r\\nattention of Franklin very earnestly to the subject of religion. He\\r\\nwrote very much upon that theme, and published a new version of the\\r\\nLord\\'s Prayer, and a lecture upon Providence and Predestination. He,\\r\\nhowever, admits that he very seldom attended any public worship,\\r\\nadding,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I had still an opinion of its propriety and its utility,\\r\\n     when rightly conducted; and I regularly paid my annual\\r\\n     subscription for the support of the only Presbyterian\\r\\n     minister.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRumors soon reached Franklin\\'s good father of Boston, of his son\\'s\\r\\nfree-thinking, and he wrote to his son in much alarm. In Franklin\\'s\\r\\nreply, he said,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"All that should be expected from me, is to keep my mind\\r\\n     open to conviction; to hear patiently and examine\\r\\n     attentively whatever is offered me for that end. And if\\r\\n     after all I continue in the same errors, I believe your\\r\\n     usual charity will induce you rather to pity and excuse,\\r\\n     than to blame me. In the meantime, your care and concern for\\r\\n     me, is what I am very thankful for. My mother grieves that\\r\\n     one of her sons is an Arian, and another an Arminian. What\\r\\n     an Arminian or an Arian is, I cannot say that I very well\\r\\n     know. The truth is, I make such distinctions very little my\\r\\n     study. I think vital religion has always suffered when\\r\\n     orthodoxy is more regarded than virtue. And the Scriptures\\r\\n     assure me that at the last day we shall not be examined what\\r\\n     we thought but what we did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin, having no revealed religion to guide him, and having no\\r\\nfoundation for his faith, but the ever-changing vagaries of his own\\r\\nfantastic imagination, could have no belief to-day, of which he had\\r\\nany certainty that he would hold the same to-morrow. He was\\r\\ncontinually abandoning one after another of the articles of his\\r\\nfantastical creed, and adopting others in their place. At length he\\r\\nsettled down upon the following simple belief, which with very\\r\\nconsiderable tenacity, but without any attempt to promulgate it, he\\r\\nadhered to for many years. It consisted of the six following articles\\r\\nwhich we give in briefest language.\\r\\n\\r\\n     1. \"There is one God.\\r\\n\\r\\n     2. \"He governs the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n     3. \"He ought to be worshipped.\\r\\n\\r\\n     4. \"Doing good is the service most acceptable to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n     5. \"Man is immortal.\\r\\n\\r\\n     6. \"In the future world the souls of men will be dealt with\\r\\n     justly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is very evident that Franklin had no great confidence in his\\r\\ntheological opinions. He studiously avoided all writing upon the\\r\\nsubject, and as far as possible all conversation. Still, with his keen\\r\\nsense of humor, he could not refrain from occasionally plunging a\\r\\npretty sharp dagger\\'s thrust into the palpable imperfections of the\\r\\nvarious and contending sects.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was very little moral power, in the creed he professed, to\\r\\narrest young men, of glowing passions, and exposed to the most\\r\\ndifficult temptations, in their downward career. No voice of Franklin\\r\\nwas heard with potency calling upon those who were thronging the broad\\r\\nroad. In a lecture upon Providence, to his companions of the Junto,\\r\\nwhich was subsequently published, and which reflects some considerable\\r\\nhonor upon the earnestness of his thoughts, he wrote,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I am especially discouraged when I reflect that you are all\\r\\n     my intimate pot-companions, who have heard me say a\\r\\n     thousand silly things in conversation, and therefore have\\r\\n     not that laudable partiality and veneration for whatever I\\r\\n     shall deliver that good people have for their spiritual\\r\\n     guides; that you have no reverence for my habit, nor for the\\r\\n     sanctity of my countenance; that you do not believe me\\r\\n     inspired, nor divinely assisted; and therefore will think\\r\\n     yourself at liberty to assert, or dissert, approve or\\r\\n     disapprove of anything I advance, canvassing and sifting it\\r\\n     as the private opinion of one of your acquaintance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThough it was Franklin\\'s assumption that his religion was one of works\\r\\nand not of faith, still it must be admitted that his life was very\\r\\ninconsistent with those principles of purity, moral loveliness and\\r\\ngood report which the Gospel enjoins. With his remarkable honesty of\\r\\nmind, in strains which we are constrained, though with regret to\\r\\nrecord, he writes,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"That hard-to-be governed passion of youth had hurried me\\r\\n     frequently into intrigues with low women that fell in my\\r\\n     way, which were attended with some expense and great\\r\\n     inconvenience, besides a continual risk to my health by\\r\\n     distemper, which of all things I dreaded, though by great\\r\\n     luck I escaped it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Parton writes, \"It was perhaps owing to his frequent delinquencies\\r\\nin this way, that his liturgy contains no allusion to a vice, which is\\r\\nof all others the most alluring to a youth of Franklin\\'s temperament.\\r\\nHe was too sincere and logical a man to go before his God and ask\\r\\nassistance against a fault which he had not fully resolved to\\r\\novercome, and that immediately. About a year after the date of his\\r\\nliturgy was born his illegitimate son William Franklin, who became\\r\\nGovernor of New Jersey. If laws were as easily executed as enacted,\\r\\nBenjamin Franklin would have received, upon this occasion, twenty-one\\r\\nlashings at the public whipping-post of Philadelphia.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The Dawn of Prosperity._\\r\\n\\r\\n     Franklin takes a house--His first job--His industry--Plans a\\r\\n     Newspaper--Enters the list as a writer--Advocates a Paper\\r\\n     currency--Purchases Keimer\\'s paper--Character of\\r\\n     Meredith--Struggles of the firm--Unexpected\\r\\n     assistance--Dissolves partnership with Meredith--Franklin\\'s\\r\\n     energetic conduct--His courtship, and marriage--Character of\\r\\n     Mrs. Franklin--Increase of luxury--Plans for a\\r\\n     library--Prosperity of Pennsylvania--Customs in\\r\\n     Philadelphia--Style of dress in 1726--Franklin\\'s social\\r\\n     position in Philadelphia--His success--A hard student.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin had now reached the end of life as an apprentice and a\\r\\njourneyman. With his friend Meredith he hired a house in the lower\\r\\npart of Market street, at the rent of about one hundred and twenty\\r\\ndollars a year. A large portion of this house he prudently re-let to\\r\\nanother mechanic who was a member of the Junto. It would seem that\\r\\nMeredith was disappointed in the amount of money he expected to raise.\\r\\nConsequently after utterly exhausting their stock of cash, they still\\r\\nfound it necessary to run deeply into debt for those appurtenances of\\r\\na printing office which were absolutely necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as they got ready for work, quite to their delight, a countryman\\r\\ncame in introduced by one of the Junto, George House, who wanted a\\r\\nfive shilling job executed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This man\\'s five shillings,\" writes Franklin, \"being our first fruits,\\r\\nand coming so seasonably, gave me more pleasure than any crown I have\\r\\nsince earned. And from the gratitude I felt toward House, has made me\\r\\noften more ready, than perhaps I otherwise should have been, to assist\\r\\nyoung beginners.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two young men devoted themselves to their work, with assiduity\\r\\nwhich was a sure precursor of success. Often Franklin was found\\r\\ndiligently employed until eleven o\\'clock at night. His industry and\\r\\nenergy soon attracted attention. A gentleman living near the office\\r\\nsaid to some of his friends:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The industry of that Franklin is superior to anything I ever saw of\\r\\nthe kind. I see him still at work when I go home from the club, and he\\r\\nis at work again before his neighbors are out of bed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis statement produced such an impression upon a merchant who was\\r\\npresent, that he called upon the young men and offered to supply them\\r\\nwith stationery on credit. Franklin\\'s literary taste, and his\\r\\nremarkable success as a writer, led him ever to cherish, as a darling\\r\\nproject, the idea of the establishing of a newspaper. In a few months\\r\\nhe had quite deliberately formed his plan; but in some way Keimer got\\r\\nwind of it, and immediately issued a prospectus for the establishment\\r\\nof a paper of his own. Though he was totally unqualified for the task\\r\\nof editorship, yet his project was quite hurtful to the plans of\\r\\nFranklin.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery much annoyed by the treachery which had revealed his plans to\\r\\nKeimer, and perceiving that his paper was unpopular and heavy,\\r\\nFranklin very wisely decided to establish his own reputation as a\\r\\nvivacious writer, before entering upon the important undertaking of\\r\\nissuing a journal in his own name. There was a small paper then\\r\\npublished in the city called \"The Mercury.\" He commenced writing a\\r\\nseries of very witty and satirical articles over the signature of\\r\\n\"Busy Body.\" The first number contained the following sentences as\\r\\nintimations of what was to come.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"It is probable that I may displease a great number of your\\r\\n     readers who will not very well like to pay ten shillings a\\r\\n     year for being told of their faults, but as most people\\r\\n     delight in censure when they themselves are not the object of\\r\\n     it, if any are offended at my publicly exposing their private\\r\\n     vices, I promise they shall have the satisfaction in a very\\r\\n     little time, in seeing their good friends and neighbors in\\r\\n     the same circumstances.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese sparkling contributions of Franklin attracted much attention,\\r\\nand created for him a growing literary reputation. The subject of\\r\\npaper money which agitated our country, was then being discussed in\\r\\nPennsylvania with intense interest. Franklin wrote a carefully studied\\r\\npamphlet entitled \"A Modest Inquiry into the Nature and Necessity of a\\r\\nPaper Currency.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis treatise, written by a young printer of but twenty-three years,\\r\\nupon one of the most difficult questions of finance, displayed great\\r\\nability. Warmly he advocated a paper currency. His arguments, however,\\r\\nwere such as would not now probably exert much influence upon the\\r\\npublic mind. The main proposition he endeavored to sustain was, that\\r\\nthere was not a sufficiency of gold and silver in Pennsylvania, for\\r\\ncarrying on the trade of the province. He therefore argued that all\\r\\nbranches of industry must languish unless the currency were increased\\r\\nby an issue of paper.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 12: This pamphlet may be found in Sparks\\' \"Works of\\r\\nFranklin,\" Vol. ii, p. 253.]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been suggested that Franklin might have been unconsciously\\r\\ninfluenced in his views, by the fact that he had been very successful\\r\\nin printing paper money, and that he anticipated still more\\r\\nemployment in that line. It is certain that Franklin\\'s pamphlet\\r\\nexerted a powerful influence at the time, and a new issue of paper\\r\\ncurrency was ordered. Franklin thought that the effect was highly\\r\\nconducive to the prosperity of the province, and he never swerved from\\r\\nthe views which he had so earnestly and successfully urged in his\\r\\npamphlet.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin\\'s sun was rapidly rising. Keimer\\'s was as rapidly sinking.\\r\\nAfter publishing thirty-nine numbers of the \"Universal Instructor\" and\\r\\nthe subscription list having dwindled to ninety, he gladly sold the\\r\\npaper for a trifle to Franklin and Meredith. The genius of Franklin\\r\\nwas immediately displayed in the improved literary character of the\\r\\npaper, and in its mechanical execution. The name was changed to the\\r\\n\"Pennsylvania Gazette.\" The first number issued by him was on Oct. 2,\\r\\n1729.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe subject of religion was almost entirely ignored. Franklin seems to\\r\\nhave become weary of the darkness and the fogs through which his\\r\\nunillumined mind had been so long painfully floundering, without\\r\\ncoming to any results upon which he could place reliance. Christianity\\r\\nhe generally treated with respect, though he could not refrain from\\r\\noccasionally giving a sly thrust at those imperfections of Christians\\r\\nwhich were so palpable to his observant mind. And though he never\\r\\nassailed that which was not inherently bad, it cannot be denied that\\r\\noccasionally his keen sarcasms brought Christianity itself into\\r\\nreproach, as if it were a religion which produced no better fruits,\\r\\nperhaps not so good, as no religion at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe business of this young firm of Franklin and Meredith, viewed in\\r\\nthe light of the grand printing enterprises of the present day, was\\r\\nindeed trivial. The two young men did all the work themselves without\\r\\neven a boy to help them. In fact Meredith, who at the best was a poor\\r\\nworkman, and who fell into intemperate habits, neglected his business,\\r\\nfrequented the ale-houses, and left all responsibility resting upon\\r\\nthe efficient shoulders of his partner.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin, who endeavored to be perfect in every thing he undertook,\\r\\nprinted his paper so admirably that it is said that there is probably\\r\\nnot a journal now in Philadelphia which is issued in better style than\\r\\n\"The Pennsylvania Gazette\" of 1729.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor seven years Franklin had been embarrassed by the thought of the\\r\\nfifty dollars which he had received from Mr. Vernon, and which had not\\r\\nyet been repaid. Mr. Vernon wrote him a very gentle intimation,\\r\\nstating that it would be very convenient for him to receive the money.\\r\\nFranklin returned a contrite and magnanimous letter. He made no\\r\\nattempt to extenuate his fault, promised immediately to strain every\\r\\nnerve to meet the debt, and in a few months paid the whole, principal\\r\\nand interest.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill the infant firm was struggling with adversity. The partners had\\r\\ncommenced operations with scarcely any capital excepting promises.\\r\\nTheir outfit cost about a thousand dollars. Mr. Meredith had been\\r\\nunfortunate in business, and found himself unable to pay the second\\r\\ninstalment promised of five hundred dollars. The stationers who\\r\\nfurnished paper began to be uneasy, for they could not but see that\\r\\nMeredith was fast going to ruin.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin was seldom in the habit of dwelling upon his misfortunes. In\\r\\nthese dark hours he wrote,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"In this distress two true friends whose kindness I have\\r\\n     never forgotten, nor ever shall forget while I can remember\\r\\n     anything, came to me separately, unknown to each other, and\\r\\n     without any application from me, offered each of them to\\r\\n     advance me all the money that should be necessary to take\\r\\n     the whole business upon myself; but they did not like my\\r\\n     continuing in partnership with Meredith, who, as they said,\\r\\n     was often seen drunk in the street, playing at low games in\\r\\n     ale-houses, much to our discredit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin generously was very reluctant to throw aside Meredith.\\r\\nDissolute as the young man had become, he could not forget that he\\r\\nwas the son of a man who had been his friend; but after carefully\\r\\npondering the question and seeing ruin stare him in the face, he said\\r\\none day to Meredith,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps your father is dissatisfied at the part you have undertaken\\r\\nin this affair of ours; and is unwilling to advance for you and me,\\r\\nwhat he would for you. If that is the case tell me, and I will resign\\r\\nthe whole to you and go about my business.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMeredith replied,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My father has really been disappointed, and is really unable. I am\\r\\nunwilling to distress him further. I see this is a business I am unfit\\r\\nfor. I was bred a farmer and it was folly in me to come to town, and\\r\\nput myself at thirty years of age an apprentice to learn a new trade.\\r\\nMany of our Welsh people are going to settle in North Carolina where\\r\\nland is cheap. I am inclined to go with them, and follow my old\\r\\nemployment. If you will take the debts of the company upon you, return\\r\\nto my father the hundred pounds he has advanced, pay my little\\r\\npersonal debts, and give me thirty pounds and a new saddle, I will\\r\\nrelinquish the partnership, and leave the whole in your hands.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese were hard terms; but there was no other way in which Franklin\\r\\ncould escape from the embarrassments of this untoward partnership. He\\r\\naccepted the proposal at once; borrowed the needful money of his\\r\\nfriends; and became his own sole partner.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrue prosperity now began to attend his indomitable industry,\\r\\nfrugality, and wisdom. The advance of the young man was necessarily\\r\\nslow, but it was sure. Well aware that his reputation with the\\r\\ncommunity would be invaluable to him, he not only endeavored to be\\r\\nindustrious, but to let it be seen by his neighbors that he left no\\r\\nstone unturned to accomplish his purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe would trundle, through the streets of Philadelphia, in a\\r\\nwheel-barrow, the paper which he purchased, by no means seeking\\r\\nby-streets where his more fashionable companions would not see him. He\\r\\ndressed with the utmost simplicity, but always in clean garments, well\\r\\ncut, and which presented his admirable form to great advantage. Never\\r\\ndid he allow himself to sink to the vulgarity of a slatternly\\r\\nappearance. He was ever ready, when engaged in the most busy\\r\\nemployments of his office, to receive without a blush, any guests,\\r\\nhowever high, who might chance to call.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tranquil months glided on. Franklin was prospered in business,\\r\\npaid his debts, and began to accumulate a little property. Our young\\r\\nphilosopher was never an impassioned lover. As he would contemplate,\\r\\nin his increasing prosperity, removing to another more commodious\\r\\noffice, so he now thought, having reached the age of twenty-four, that\\r\\nit might be expedient for him to have a home of his own, and a wife to\\r\\ntake care of his domestic affairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had let a portion of the house which he used for his printing\\r\\noffice, to a mechanic of the Junto by the name of Godfrey. He\\r\\nconferred with Mrs. Godfrey upon the subject. She had a relative, a\\r\\nvery pretty girl, Miss Godfrey, whom she highly recommended and\\r\\nbrought, as it were by accident, to take tea with Franklin. She was\\r\\ngraceful, amiable, and a child of parents well to do in the world.\\r\\nFranklin was a remarkably handsome and fascinating young man. The\\r\\ncourtship proceeded successfully and rapidly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reader will be interested in seeing Franklin\\'s own account of this\\r\\naffair. He writes, in his Autobiography:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Mrs. Godfrey projected a match with a relation\\'s daughter,\\r\\n     took opportunities of bringing us often together, till a\\r\\n     serious courtship on my part ensued; the girl being, in\\r\\n     herself, very deserving. The old folks encouraged me by\\r\\n     continual invitations to supper, and by leaving us together,\\r\\n     till at length it was time to explain. Mrs. Godfrey managed\\r\\n     our little treaty. I let her know I expected as much money\\r\\n     with their daughter as would pay off my remaining debt for\\r\\n     the printing house; which I believe was not then above a\\r\\n     hundred pounds. She brought me word they had no such sum to\\r\\n     spare; I said they might mortgage their house in the\\r\\n     loan-office. The answer to this, after some days, was, that\\r\\n     they did not approve the match; that, on inquiry of Mr.\\r\\n     Bradford, they had been informed the printing business was\\r\\n     not a profitable one, the types would soon be worn out, and\\r\\n     more wanted; that Keimer and David Harvy had failed one after\\r\\n     the other, and I should probably soon follow them; and\\r\\n     therefore I was forbidden the house, and the daughter was\\r\\n     shut up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOccasionally Franklin had gone to the home of Mrs. Read, the mother of\\r\\nthe unhappy Deborah. His conscience reproached him for his conduct to\\r\\nthat good girl. She was always dejected and solitary, and with a\\r\\nbroken heart clung to her mother, her only friend. It is doubtful\\r\\nwhether she were ever legally married to Rogers. It was rumored that\\r\\nat the time of their marriage, he was the husband of one, if not more\\r\\nwives. If legally married, there was another serious obstacle in her\\r\\npath. Rogers had run away to the West Indies. Rumor alone had\\r\\nannounced his death. He might be still living.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin\\'s sympathy gradually became excited in her behalf. And at\\r\\nlength he proposed that, regardless of all the risks, they should be\\r\\nmarried. It seems that he had announced to her very distinctly that he\\r\\nhad a living child, and very honorably he had decided that that child\\r\\nof dishonor was to be taken home and trained as his own.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese were sad nuptials. The world-weary wife knew not but that she\\r\\nhad another husband still living, and a stigma, indelible, rested upon\\r\\nFranklin. The marriage took place on the first of September, 1730. It\\r\\nsubsequently appears that Rogers, the potter, was really dead. The\\r\\nchild was taken home and reared with all possible tenderness and care.\\r\\nIt is a little remarkable that nothing is known of what became of the\\r\\nmother of that child. The boy grew up to manhood, espoused the Tory\\r\\ncause, when the Tories were hunting his father to hang him, and by his\\r\\nungrateful, rebellious conduct, pierced his heart with a thousand\\r\\nempoisoned daggers.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Franklin proved in all respects an excellent woman, and an\\r\\nadmirable wife for her calm, philosophic and unimpassioned husband.\\r\\nFranklin never had a journeyman in his office who performed his\\r\\nfunctions more entirely to his satisfaction, than his wife discharged\\r\\nher responsible duties. She was always amiable, industrious and\\r\\nthrifty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a little shop attached to the printing office which\\r\\nMrs. Franklin tended. She also aided her husband in folding and\\r\\ndistributing the papers, and with a mother\\'s love trained, in the\\r\\nrudiments of education, the child whose mother was lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin, in his characteristic, kindly appreciation of the services\\r\\nof all who were faithful in his employ, speaks in the following\\r\\ncommendatory terms of the industrial excellencies of his wife. When\\r\\nfar away dazzled by the splendors, and bewildered by the flattery of\\r\\nEuropean courts, he wrote to her,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"It was a comfort to me to recollect that I had once been\\r\\n     clothed, from head to foot, in woolen and linen of my wife\\'s\\r\\n     manufacture, and that I never was prouder of any dress in my\\r\\n     life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Franklin\\'s Autobiography, as published by Sparks, we read, \"We have\\r\\nan English proverb that says, \\'He that would thrive, must ask his\\r\\nwife.\\' It was lucky for me that I had one as much disposed to industry\\r\\nand frugality as myself. She assisted me cheerfully in my business,\\r\\nfolding and stitching pamphlets, tending shop, purchasing old linen\\r\\nrags, for the paper-makers, etc. We kept no idle servants; our table\\r\\nwas plain and simple, our furniture of the cheapest. For instance, my\\r\\nbreakfast was, for a long time, bread and milk, (no tea) and I ate it\\r\\nout of a two-penny earthern porringer, with a pewter-spoon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But mark how luxury will enter families, and make a progress in spite\\r\\nof principle. Being called one morning to breakfast, I found it in a\\r\\nchina bowl, with a spoon of silver. They had been bought for me\\r\\nwithout my knowledge, by my wife, and had cost her the enormous sum of\\r\\nthree and twenty shillings; for which she had no other excuse or\\r\\napology to make, but that she thought her husband deserved a silver\\r\\nspoon and china bowl, as well as any of his neighbors. This was the\\r\\nfirst appearance of plate or china in our house; which afterward, in a\\r\\ncourse of years, as our wealth increased, augmented gradually to\\r\\nseveral hundred pounds in value.\"[13]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 13: Life of Franklin, by Sparks, p. 102.]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile thus engaged he conceived the idea of establishing a public\\r\\nsubscription library. His knowledge of human nature taught him that if\\r\\nhe presented the enterprise as his own, feelings of jealousy might be\\r\\nexcited, and it might be imagined that he was influenced by personal\\r\\nambition. He therefore said that a number of gentlemen had adopted the\\r\\nplan, and had requested him to visit the lovers of books and of\\r\\nreading, and solicit their subscriptions. Each subscriber was to\\r\\ncontribute two pounds to start the enterprise, and to pay a yearly\\r\\nassessment of ten shillings.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the arduous labors of five months, Franklin obtained fifty names.\\r\\nWith this the enterprise commenced. Such was the origin of the\\r\\nPhiladelphia Library, now one of the most important institutions of\\r\\nthe kind in our land. In the year 1861, seventy thousand volumes were\\r\\nreported as on its shelves.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhiladelphia contained a population of nearly ten thousand people.\\r\\nPennsylvania was decidedly the central point for European emigration.\\r\\nIts climate was delightful; its soil fertile; and William Penn\\'s\\r\\nhumane policy with the Indians had secured for the colony peace and\\r\\nfriendship with the native inhabitants for more than fifty years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe white man, on this continent, has told his own story. The Indians\\r\\nhave had no historians. But nothing is more clear than that in almost\\r\\nevery instance they were goaded to war by the unendurable wrongs which\\r\\nwere inflicted upon them.[14] Until Braddock\\'s dreadful defeat,\\r\\nPennsylvania had scarcely known a single alarm. In the summer of 1749,\\r\\ntwelve thousand Germans landed at Philadelphia. This was the average\\r\\nnumber for many years. The policy of William Penn had been to\\r\\nestablish upon the banks of the Delaware, an extended and beautiful\\r\\nvillage, where every house should have its lawn and its garden for\\r\\nvegetables and flowers. In the year 1732, when Franklin was twenty-six\\r\\nyears of age, the dwellings of this village were mostly of brick or\\r\\nstone, and were spread along the banks of the river for the distance\\r\\nof a mile, with streets running back into the interior to the distance\\r\\nof about half a mile.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 14: \"No other British colony admits of the evidence of an\\r\\nIndian against a white man; nor are the complaints of Indians against\\r\\nwhite men duly regarded in other colonies; whereby these poor people\\r\\nendure the most cruel treatment from the very worst of our own people,\\r\\nwithout hope of redress. And all the Indian wars in our colonies were\\r\\noccasioned by such means.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nImportance of the British Plantations in America to these Kingdoms,\\r\\nLondon. 1731.]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prosperity of Philadelphia, indeed of Pennsylvania, was\\r\\nremarkable. Provisions and the most delicious fruits were in great\\r\\nabundance. Even the pigs were fattened upon the most luscious peaches.\\r\\nEach family in the city kept its cow, which grazed upon the common\\r\\nlands on the outskirts of the town. The Philadelphia of that period\\r\\nwas a green village, beautifully shaded by trees, and presenting to\\r\\nevery visitor an aspect of rare attractions. Professor Peter Kalm, who\\r\\npublished an exceedingly interesting account of his travels in North\\r\\nAmerica between the years 1748 and 1751, writes,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"There were fine orchards all about the city. The country\\r\\n     people in Sweden and Finland guard their turnips more\\r\\n     carefully than the people here do the most exquisite fruits.\\r\\n     A Philadelphian has so much liberty and abundance that he\\r\\n     lives in his house like a king.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Quakers, or as they prefer to be called, the Friends, at that time\\r\\ncomposed about one-third of the population of Philadelphia, and\\r\\none-half of the State of Pennsylvania. They were a remarkably\\r\\nintelligent, industrious and worthy people. Probably a better and more\\r\\nthrifty community was never colonized on this globe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe state of society has greatly changed since that day, and customs,\\r\\nwhich were then deemed essential, have since become obsolete. For\\r\\ninstance, the whipping-post, the pillory, and the stocks, were\\r\\nprominent in the market-place and were in frequent use. There was a\\r\\npublic whipper, who, for his repulsive services, received a salary of\\r\\nfifty dollars a year. Until as late as 1760, women were frequently\\r\\npublicly whipped. It is said that a whipping occurred on an average,\\r\\ntwice a month.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dress of gentlemen was gaudy and extravagant, unsurpassed by that\\r\\nof French or British courtiers. Immense wigs, with their profusion of\\r\\nwaves or curls, were in use by the gentry. Very tight knee-breeches\\r\\nwere worn, with silk stockings, and shoes embellished with immense\\r\\nsilver buckles, highly polished. Their coats were richly embroidered,\\r\\noften of silk velvet, and their full flow reached below the knees.\\r\\nRuffled shirts and ruffled wrist-bands of linen, of snowy whiteness,\\r\\nadded to the beauty of the dress. A jewelled scabbard containing a\\r\\npolished sword hung by the side. A three-cornered hat completed this\\r\\nshowy attire. There is not a Rocky Mountain Indian in his most\\r\\ngorgeous war-dress of paint and plumes, who would attract more\\r\\nattention walking down Broadway, than would Benjamin Franklin as he\\r\\nwas painted in 1726.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis portrait was taken when he was in London, working as a journeyman\\r\\nprinter. Contrary to the general impression, Franklin was then, and\\r\\nthrough all his life, fully conscious of the advantages which dress\\r\\nconfers. When surrounded by the homage of the court of Versailles,\\r\\nthere was no courtier in those magnificent saloons more attentive to\\r\\nhis attire than was Benjamin Franklin. His keen sagacity taught him\\r\\nthe advantage of appearing in a dress entirely different from that of\\r\\nthe splendid assembly around him, and thus he attracted universal\\r\\nobservation. But never did he appear in the presence of these lords\\r\\nand ladies but in a costly garb to which he had devoted much\\r\\nattention.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration]\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Parton, speaking of the portrait which Franklin then had painted\\r\\nin London, says,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The fair, full, smiling face of Franklin is surrounded in\\r\\n     this picture by a vast and stiff horse-hair wig; and his\\r\\n     well-developed figure shows imposingly in a voluminous and\\r\\n     decorated coat that reaches nearly to his heels. Under his\\r\\n     left arm he carries his cocked hat. His manly bosom heaves\\r\\n     under snowy ruffles, and his extensive wrist-bands are\\r\\n     exposed to view by the shortness of his coat sleeves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween the years 1740 and 1775, while abundance reigned in\\r\\nPennsylvania, and there was peace in all her borders, a more happy and\\r\\nprosperous population could not perhaps be found on this globe. In\\r\\nevery home there was comfort. The people generally were highly moral,\\r\\nand knowledge was extensively diffused. Americans, who visited Europe,\\r\\nwere deeply impressed by the contrast. In the Old World they saw\\r\\neverywhere indications of poverty and suffering. Franklin wrote, after\\r\\na tour in Great Britain in 1772,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Had I never been in the American colonies, but were to form\\r\\n     my judgment of civil society by what I have lately seen, I\\r\\n     should never advise a nation of savages to admit of\\r\\n     civilization. For, I assure you, that in the possession and\\r\\n     enjoyment of the various comforts of life, compared with\\r\\n     these people, every Indian is a gentleman; and the effect of\\r\\n     this kind of civil society seems to be the depressing\\r\\n     multitudes below the savage state, that a few may be raised\\r\\n     above it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYet let it not be supposed that the effects of the fall were not\\r\\nvisible here, or that man\\'s inhumanity to man had ceased. There were\\r\\nbickerings, and heart burnings, and intense political struggles, in\\r\\nwhich the strong endeavored to extend their power, and the weak\\r\\nendeavored to throw off the shackles with which they were bound.\\r\\nWilliam Penn complains of the ambitious politicians who he said\\r\\nthought--\"nothing taller than themselves but the trees.\" John Adams\\r\\ndenounced in severest terms the tricks of the petty politicians; and\\r\\nspeaking of the more ambitious ones who sought the positions of\\r\\ngovernor or custom-house officers, he writes:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"These seekers are actuated by a more ravenous sort of\\r\\n     ambition and avarice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor twenty years Franklin continued a prosperous but uneventful life,\\r\\nas an active business man in Philadelphia. His integrity, his\\r\\nsagacity, and his prosperity, rapidly increased the esteem in which he\\r\\nwas held. But still he was engaged in business as a printer and a\\r\\nshop-keeper, which would not now give him admission into what he\\r\\ncalled the higher circles of society.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe not only edited, printed and published his newspaper, but he also\\r\\nkept books for sale and a small quantity of stationery, and also was a\\r\\nbinder of books. He made and sold ink; was an extensive dealer in\\r\\nrags; and soap and feathers could be purchased at his shop. We find in\\r\\nhis advertisements the announcement of coffee and other groceries for\\r\\nsale.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd still his printing office gradually became the nucleus for the\\r\\ngathering of the most intelligent and influential men. If any\\r\\nimportant project was on foot, it was deemed essential to consult\\r\\nBenjamin Franklin. His Gazette proved a great success, and was\\r\\nincomparably the ablest paper published in the colonies.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 15: Life and Works of John Adams, Vol. ii, p. 165.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin\\'s editorials were very sparkling, and are considered as among\\r\\nthe most brilliant of his intellectual efforts. He was almost\\r\\ninvariably good natured, and the design of all he wrote, was to\\r\\npromote integrity and kindly feeling. He would write an article, as if\\r\\nfrom a correspondent, which would give him an opportunity to return an\\r\\namusing article in the next number. A complete file of the paper is\\r\\npreserved in the Philadelphia Library.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1732, Franklin issued the first number of the Almanac, called Poor\\r\\nRichard, which subsequently attained such wide renown. The popularity\\r\\nof the work was astonishing; for twenty-five years it averaged ten\\r\\nthousand copies a year. This was a wonderful sale in those times.\\r\\nEverybody was quoting the pithy sayings of Poor Richard.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 16: \"And now after the lapse of one hundred and thirty\\r\\nyears, we find persons willing to give twenty-five dollars for a\\r\\nsingle number, and several hundred dollars for a complete set. Nay,\\r\\nthe reading matter of several of the numbers, has been republished\\r\\nwithin these few years, and that republication already begins to\\r\\ncommand the price of a rarity.\"--_Parton\\'s Life of Franklin_, Vol. i,\\r\\np. 231.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin was an extensive reader. He had a memory almost miraculous;\\r\\nand his mind was so constituted, that it eagerly grasped and retained\\r\\nany sharp or witty sayings. Thus, though many of the maxims of Poor\\r\\nRichard originated with him, others were gleaned from the witticisms\\r\\nof past ages, upon which Franklin placed the imprint of his own\\r\\npeculiar genius. I give a few of those renowned maxims which soon\\r\\nbecame as household words, in every shop and dwelling of our land.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"There is no little enemy.\" \"Three may keep a secret if two\\r\\n     of them are dead.\" \"He is no clown who drives the plough, but\\r\\n     he that does clownish things.\" \"Wealth is not his that has\\r\\n     it, but his that enjoys it.\" \"The noblest question in the\\r\\n     world is, \\'what good may I do in it.\\'\" \"Keep your eye wide\\r\\n     open before marriage; half shut afterward.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin was not a poet. He could scheme easily, but even his rhymes\\r\\nwere poor. His sense of delicacy was quite obtuse, but perhaps not\\r\\nmore so, than we ought to expect from the unrefined times in which he\\r\\nlived.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 17: \"Poor Richard, at this day, would be reckoned an\\r\\nindecent production. All great humorists were all indecent, before\\r\\nCharles Dickens. They used certain words which are now never\\r\\npronounced by polite persons, and are never printed by respectable\\r\\nprinters; and they referred freely to certain subjects which are\\r\\nfamiliar to every living creature, but which it is now agreed among\\r\\ncivilized beings, shall not be topics of conversation. In this respect\\r\\nPoor Richard was no worse, and not much better than other colonial\\r\\nperiodicals, some of which contain things incredibly obscene,\\r\\nas much so as the strongest passages of Sterne, Smollet and De\\r\\nFoe.\"--_Parton._]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe increasing circulation of the Pennsylvania Gazette, the extensive\\r\\nsale of Poor Richard, and the success of many of the small books which\\r\\nFranklin published, soon placed the finances of Franklin in a very\\r\\nflourishing condition. This enabled him to send for every important\\r\\nwork published in England. As he was never an hour in idleness, and\\r\\nseldom entered any place of popular amusement, he found time to study\\r\\nall these solid and useful works. The superior powers with which God\\r\\nhad endowed him, enabled him to glean from their pages, and store up\\r\\nin his memory, all that was most valuable. By these indefatigable\\r\\nstudies, he was rapidly becoming one of the most learned of men, and\\r\\nwas preparing himself for that brilliant career, in which, as a\\r\\nstatesman and a philosopher, he stood in the first ranks of those who\\r\\nhad been deemed the great men of earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis first entrance to public life was as Clerk to the General\\r\\nAssembly, which was then the Legislature of the Pennsylvania Colony.\\r\\nThis was an office of but little emolument or honor. His first\\r\\nelection was unanimous. The second year, though successful, he was\\r\\nopposed by an influential member.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin, who wished to have every one his friend, was anxious to\\r\\nconciliate him. He accomplished his purpose shrewdly--perhaps\\r\\ncunningly, is not too strong a word to use. Having heard that the\\r\\ngentleman had a very rare and valuable book in his library, he wrote\\r\\nhim a very polite and flattering letter, soliciting the loan of it. No\\r\\nman could pen such an epistle more adroitly than Franklin.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a few days he returned the book with one of his most exquisite\\r\\nnotes of thanks. The gentleman was caught in the trap. Charmed with\\r\\nthe urbanity Franklin displayed in the correspondence, the next time\\r\\nhe met the philosopher, he grasped him cordially by the hand. Though\\r\\nhe had never spoken to him before, he invited him to his house.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin, commenting upon this adventure, writes,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"He ever after manifested a readiness to serve me on all\\r\\n     occasions, so that we became great friends, and our\\r\\n     friendship continued to his death. This is another instance\\r\\n     of the truth of an old maxim I had learned, which says \\'He\\r\\n     that hath once done you a kindness will be more ready to do\\r\\n     you another than he whom you yourself have obliged,\\' and it\\r\\n     shows how much more profitable it is prudently to remove\\r\\n     than to resent, return, and continue inimical proceedings.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was something in this transaction, an apparent want of\\r\\nsincerity, an approach to trickery, which will impress many readers\\r\\npainfully. It was a shrewd manoeuvre, skillfully contrived, and\\r\\nsuccessfully executed. The perfect sincerity of a friendly and\\r\\nmagnanimous mind is the safest guide in all the emergencies of life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Religious and Philosophic Views._\\r\\n\\r\\n     Studious habits--New religion--Personal habits--Church of\\r\\n     the Free and Easy--His many accomplishments--The career of\\r\\n     Hemphall--Birth and Death of Franklin\\'s son--The Ministry of\\r\\n     Whitefield--Remarkable friendship between the philosopher\\r\\n     and the preacher--Prosperity of Franklin--His convivial\\r\\n     habits--The defense of Philadelphia--Birth of a\\r\\n     daughter--The Philadelphia Academy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin was a perservering and laborious student, for whatever he\\r\\nread he studied. With increasing intellectual tastes, he found time\\r\\nevery day to devote many hours to his books. His reading was of the\\r\\nmost elevated and instructive kind. It consisted almost exclusively of\\r\\nscientific treatises, and of history, biography, voyages and travels.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis mind was still struggling and floundering in the midst of\\r\\nreligious and philosophical speculations. He seems, from some\\r\\nunexplained reason, to have been very unwilling to accept the religion\\r\\nof Jesus Christ; and yet he was inspired undeniably by a very noble\\r\\ndesire to be a good man, to attain a high position in morality.\\r\\nEarnestly he endeavored to frame for himself some scheme which would\\r\\nenable him to accomplish that purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this time he wrote,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Few in public affairs act from a mere view of the good of\\r\\n     their country, whatever they may pretend. Fewer still in\\r\\n     public affairs act with a view to the good of mankind. There\\r\\n     seems to me, at present, great occasion to raise a \\'United\\r\\n     Party for Virtue,\\' by forming the virtuous and good of all\\r\\n     nations into a regular body, to be governed by suitable good\\r\\n     and wise rules, which good and wise men may probably be more\\r\\n     unanimous in their obedience to, than common people are to\\r\\n     common laws. I at present, think, that whoever attempts this\\r\\n     aright, and is well qualified, cannot fail of pleasing God,\\r\\n     and of meeting with success.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nInfluenced by these exalted motives, he concentrated all the energies\\r\\nof his well informed mind to the organization of a new religion. To\\r\\nthis church he gave the name of \"The Society of the Free and Easy.\"\\r\\nThe members were to be Free from vice, and consequently, Easy in mind.\\r\\nThe first article of his creed was that he would have no creed. And\\r\\nyet this religion, which drew an antagonistic distinction between\\r\\nfaith and works, denouncing all faith at the same time announced that\\r\\nits fundamental and absolutely essential faith was that piety\\r\\nconsisted in cherishing the ordinarily recognized virtues. These were\\r\\nTemperance, Silence, Order, Resolution, Frugality, Industry,\\r\\nSincerity, Justice, Moderation, Cleanliness, Tranquillity, Charity and\\r\\nHumility.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis ritual consisted in devoting one week to the cultivation of each\\r\\nof these virtues. He had no Sabbath, no preached Gospel, no\\r\\nSacraments. But his creed, with its corresponding practice, certainly\\r\\nexerted a very powerful influence, and in many respects beneficial,\\r\\nupon his own mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith his list of virtues before him, this remarkable young man\\r\\ncommenced the effort vigorously to attain perfection. The Christian\\r\\nreader will not be at all surprised to read from Franklin\\'s pen the\\r\\nfollowing account of the result:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I was surprised to find myself so much fuller of faults than\\r\\n     I had imagined. But I had the satisfaction of seeing them\\r\\n     diminish. After a while I went through one course only in a\\r\\n     year, and afterwards only one in several years; till at\\r\\n     length I omitted them entirely, being employed in voyages and\\r\\n     business abroad, with a multiplicity of affairs that\\r\\n     interfered.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin was a very proud man. He could not but be conscious of his\\r\\ngreat superiority over most of those with whom he associated. He avows\\r\\nthat the virtue of humility he never could attain. The semblance of\\r\\nthat virtue he could easily assume, but he says that the pride of his\\r\\nheart was such that had he attained it, he would have been proud of\\r\\nhis humility. He adopted the following as the ordinary routine of\\r\\nlife.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rose at five, very carefully performed his ablutions, and then\\r\\noffered a brief prayer to a being whom he called \"Powerful Goodness.\"\\r\\nWhy he should have preferred that address to the more simple one of\\r\\n\"Our Heavenly Father,\" we know not. He then laid out the business of\\r\\nthe day, and for a short time directed his mind to the especial virtue\\r\\nwhich he intended that day and week to cherish.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 18: \"It was about this time I conceived the bold and arduous\\r\\nproject of arriving at moral perfection. I wished to live without\\r\\ncommitting any fault at any time. As I knew, or thought I knew what\\r\\nwas right and wrong, I did not see why I might not always do the one\\r\\nand avoid the other. But I soon found that I had undertaken a task of\\r\\nmore difficulty than I had imagined.\"--Autobiography, p. 105.]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the freshness of all his morning energies he devoted himself to his\\r\\nbooks for an hour and a half. This brought him to breakfast-time. At\\r\\neight o\\'clock he commenced work in his shop, to which he devoted\\r\\nhimself assiduously until twelve. An hour was then allowed for dinner\\r\\nand rest. At one he returned to the arduous labors of his shop, labors\\r\\nwhich engrossed all his energies, and continued the employment until\\r\\nsix. His day\\'s hard work was then ordinarily closed. He took his\\r\\nsupper, received his friends, or more commonly read and studied until\\r\\nten o\\'clock at night, when almost invariably he retired to his bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis mind still for a time continued much interested in his plan for\\r\\nthe church of the Free and Easy. We find among his papers that he\\r\\ndecided that candidates for admission should, after a careful\\r\\nexamination, to ascertain that their creed was, to have no creed, and\\r\\nthat their faith was, to abjure all faith, be subject to a probation\\r\\nof thirteen weeks. It seems that no candidate ever applied for\\r\\nadmission. There were no apostles to wander abroad proclaiming the new\\r\\ngospel. Increasing business absorbed Franklin\\'s time, and the new\\r\\nchurch was forgotten.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sole motive which Franklin urged to inspire to action, was\\r\\nself-interest. \"You should be honest,\" he would say, \"because it is\\r\\npolitic. You abstain from vice for the same reason that you should not\\r\\ndrink poison, for it will hurt you.\" In the enforcement of these views\\r\\nhe writes,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"It was my design to explain and enforce this doctrine,\\r\\n     _that vicious actions are not hurtful because they are\\r\\n     forbidden, but forbidden because they are hurtful_. It was,\\r\\n     therefore, every one\\'s interest to be virtuous who wished to\\r\\n     be happy in this world. And I should from this circumstance\\r\\n     (there being always in the world a number of rich\\r\\n     merchants, nobility, states and princes, who have need of\\r\\n     honest instruments for the management of their affairs, and\\r\\n     such being so rare) have endeavored to convince young\\r\\n     persons that no qualities are so likely to make a poor man\\'s\\r\\n     fortune as those of probity and integrity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be doubted whether such considerations ever made a truly good\\r\\nman. Virtue must be loved for its own sake. Vice must be deserted for\\r\\nits inherent baseness, even though it may bring a great reward.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin, in the prosecution of his studies, devoted himself to\\r\\nFrench, Spanish, Italian, and even to Latin. In all these he became a\\r\\nproficient. His mind was wonderfully prompt in the acquisition of\\r\\nknowledge. He could hardly have devoted himself more assiduously and\\r\\nsuccessfully to these studies, had some good angel whispered in the\\r\\near of the young printer the astounding intelligence, \"You are yet to\\r\\nbe the ambassador of the United States to European courts. You are to\\r\\nappear in those glittering assemblages as the equal of the highest\\r\\nnoble; and are to enjoy the hospitalities of kings and queens.\\r\\nFamiliarity with these languages, and the intellectual culture you are\\r\\nthus acquiring will be of more value to you than mines of gold.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis remarkable man prized all branches of knowledge; and seemed to\\r\\nexcel in all. He devoted much attention to music. With much skill he\\r\\nplayed upon the harp, the guitar, the violin, and the violincello.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the year 1734, a young preacher by the name of Hemphall came to\\r\\nPhiladelphia from England. He was deemed by the orthodox clergy, very\\r\\nheterodox in his opinions. Probably suspicions of his orthodoxy were\\r\\nenhanced from the fact that he brought high testimonials of eloquence\\r\\nfrom several of the most prominent deists and free-thinkers in\\r\\nEngland. He was very fluent, at times very eloquent, and Franklin was\\r\\ncharmed with the man and his doctrines.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoldly denouncing all creeds, and all religious faith, he announced it\\r\\nas _his_ creed and _his_ faith that piety consists in conduct alone.\\r\\nCrowds flocked to hear him. One day, after preaching a very eloquent\\r\\nsermon, some one discovered that he had stolen that sermon from Dr.\\r\\nJames Foster, the most popular preacher in London. An investigation\\r\\ntook place, in which he was compelled to acknowledge that he had\\r\\nstolen every one of his sermons. Franklin writes,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"This detection gave many of our party disgust, who\\r\\n     accordingly abandoned his cause, and occasioned our more\\r\\n     speedy discomfiture in the synod. I stuck by him, however. I\\r\\n     rather approved his giving us good sermons composed by\\r\\n     others, than bad ones of his own, though the latter was the\\r\\n     practice of our common teachers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHad the young man said frankly, \"I am rehearsing to you the most\\r\\neloquent sermons of the most eloquent English divines,\" no one could\\r\\nhave found any fault. But for him to assume that the sermons were his\\r\\nown, and that he personally was entitled to the credit of whatever\\r\\npower they exhibited, was certainly practicing deception. It was a\\r\\ngross violation of Franklin\\'s cardinal virtue of sincerity. It was\\r\\nunworthy of Franklin, in his charitable regard for the offender, to\\r\\ngloss over the real criminality of the offence.\\r\\n\\r\\nA year after Franklin\\'s marriage, a son was born to him, to whom\\r\\nhe gave the name of Francis Folger Franklin. All accounts agree\\r\\nin describing the child as endowed with remarkable beauty and\\r\\nintelligence. Probably Franklin never loved any being as he loved that\\r\\nchild. In the year 1736, when this wonderful boy was but four years of\\r\\nage, he was seized with the small-pox and died. Even the philosophic\\r\\nFranklin was almost crushed by the terrible calamity. The cheering\\r\\nviews of the Christian faith could not sustain him. He had no vivid\\r\\nconception of his cherub boy an angel in Heaven awaiting his father\\'s\\r\\narrival. He could only say that \"I am _inclined to believe_ that my\\r\\nchild has not passed away into utter annihilation; but who knows? Many\\r\\nof the wisest and best on earth utterly discard the idea of a future\\r\\nexistence. They deem the thought the conceit of ignorance and\\r\\nfanaticism.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe read the following epitaph on his little grave-stone with much\\r\\nsympathy for the bereaved father. He could only write\\r\\n\\r\\n                  Francis F.\\r\\n         Son of Benjamin and Deborah\\r\\n                   Franklin.\\r\\n          Deceased November 12, 1736,\\r\\n     Aged four years, one month and one day.\\r\\n        The delight of all who knew him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the year 1739, Rev. George Whitefield arrived in Philadelphia. It\\r\\nis remarkable that a warm friendship should have sprung up between men\\r\\nso very diverse in character. But Franklin could not be insensible to\\r\\nthe wonderful power of this preacher, in promoting public morals, and\\r\\nin transforming the worst of men into valuable citizens, faithfully\\r\\nperforming all the duties of life. It is surprising that this effect\\r\\nof the Gospel did not teach him that Christianity is the \"wisdom of\\r\\nGod, and the power of God to salvation.\" _Love_ was emphatically the\\r\\nmessage which Whitefield, with tearful eyes and throbbing heart,\\r\\nproclaimed to the wicked and the sorrowing. \"God so _loved the world_,\\r\\nthat he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him\\r\\nshould not perish but should have everlasting life.\" Christ \"came not\\r\\ninto the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him\\r\\nmight be saved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch were the themes which this apostolic preacher unfolded, and which\\r\\nmoved human hearts, in these new colonies as seventeen hundred years\\r\\nago they were moved by the preaching of our Lord Jesus Christ, and his\\r\\ndisciple Paul, upon the plains of Asia.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhitefield taught that _belief_ controlled conduct. As a man sincerely\\r\\nbelieves so will he act. Franklin, with his accustomed candor, in his\\r\\nAutobiography, wrote in the following terms, the effects of the\\r\\npreaching of this remarkable reformer:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The multitudes of all sects and denominations that attended\\r\\n     his sermons were enormous. It was wonderful to see the\\r\\n     change soon made in the manners of our inhabitants. From\\r\\n     being thoughtless or indifferent about religion, it seemed\\r\\n     as if all the world were growing religious; so that one\\r\\n     could not walk through the town, in an evening, without\\r\\n     hearing psalms sung in different families of every street.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Mr. Whitefield, on leaving us, went preaching all the way\\r\\n     through the colonies to Georgia. The settlement of that\\r\\n     province had been lately begun; but instead of being made\\r\\n     with hardy, industrious husbandmen, accustomed to labor, the\\r\\n     only people fit for such an enterprise, it was with families\\r\\n     of broken shop-keepers, and other insolvent debtors; many of\\r\\n     indolent and idle habits, taken out of the jails who, being\\r\\n     set down in the woods, unqualified for clearing land, and\\r\\n     unable to endure the hardships of a new settlement, perished\\r\\n     in numbers, leaving many helpless children unprovided for.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The sight of their miserable situation inspired the\\r\\n     benevolent heart of Mr. Whitefield with the idea of building\\r\\n     an Orphan House there in which they might be supported and\\r\\n     educated. Returning northward, he preached up this charity,\\r\\n     and made large collections.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I did not disapprove of the design; but as Georgia was then\\r\\n     destitute of materials and workmen, and it was proposed to\\r\\n     send them from Philadelphia at a great expense, I thought it\\r\\n     would have been better to have built the house at\\r\\n     Philadelphia, and brought the children to it. This I\\r\\n     advised. But he was resolute in his first project, rejected\\r\\n     my counsel, and I therefore refused to contribute.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I happened soon after to attend one of his sermons, in the\\r\\n     course of which I perceived he intended to finish with a\\r\\n     collection, and I silently resolved he should get nothing\\r\\n     from me. I had in my pocket a handful of copper money, three\\r\\n     or four silver dollars, and five pistoles in gold, (about\\r\\n     twenty-five dollars). As he proceeded I began to soften, and\\r\\n     concluded to give the copper; another stroke of his oratory\\r\\n     made me ashamed of that, and determined me to give the\\r\\n     silver; and he finished so admirably that I emptied my\\r\\n     pockets wholly into the collector\\'s dish, gold and all.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Some of Mr. Whitefield\\'s enemies affected to suppose that\\r\\n     he would apply these collections to his own private\\r\\n     emolument. But I, who was intimately acquainted with him,\\r\\n     being employed in printing his sermons and journals, never\\r\\n     had the least suspicion of his integrity; but am to this day\\r\\n     decidedly of the opinion, that he was in all his conduct a\\r\\n     perfectly honest man; and methinks my testimony ought have\\r\\n     the more weight, as we had no religious connection. He used,\\r\\n     indeed, sometimes to pray for my conversion, but never had\\r\\n     the satisfaction of believing that his prayers were heard.\\r\\n     Ours was a friendship sincere on both sides, and lasted to\\r\\n     his death.\"[19]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 19: \"Autobiography of Franklin,\" as given by Sparks, p.\\r\\n139.]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt one time Franklin wrote to Whitefield, in Boston, inviting him, as\\r\\nhe was about to come to Philadelphia, to make his house his home. The\\r\\ndevout preacher replied,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you make this offer for Christ\\'s sake you will not lose your\\r\\nreward.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPromptly the philosopher rejected any such motive, and rejoined,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not be mistaken. It was not for Christ\\'s sake I invited you, but\\r\\nfor your own sake.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn all the numerous letters, essays, and philosophical and religious\\r\\ndisquisitions of Franklin, we seldom, I think, find a sentiment\\r\\nindicative of any high appreciation of the character of Jesus Christ;\\r\\nor the debt of gratitude we owe to him, either for his teaching or for\\r\\nhis example. As Franklin discarded all idea of the Atonement, he of\\r\\ncourse could not express any gratitude for that which is, to the\\r\\nChristian, the crowning act even of divine love. This Saviour, to\\r\\nmillions who cannot be counted, has proved, even if the comfort be a\\r\\ndelusion, in temptation, disappointment, and death, more precious than\\r\\nit is in the power of words to declare.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne article from Franklin\\'s newspaper, published in the year 1740,\\r\\ngives an idea of the extraordinary interest which the preaching of\\r\\nWhitefield excited.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"On Thursday last the Reverend Mr. Whitefield left this city,\\r\\n     and was accompanied to Chester by about one hundred and\\r\\n     fifty horse; and preached there to about seven thousand\\r\\n     people. On Friday he preached twice at Willings Town to about\\r\\n     five thousand. On Saturday, at Newcastle, to about two\\r\\n     thousand five hundred; and the same evening at Christiana\\r\\n     Bridge to about three thousand; on Sunday at White Clay\\r\\n     Creek, he preached twice, resting about half an hour between\\r\\n     the sermons, to eight thousand, of whom three thousand, it is\\r\\n     computed, came on horseback. It rained most of the time, and\\r\\n     yet they stood in the open air.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe keenness of the scrutiny with which Franklin watched all the\\r\\noperations of nature, led him to the discovery of the before unknown\\r\\nfact that the fierce north-east storms which sweep our Atlantic coast\\r\\ninvariably begin in the south-west, and move backwards, diminishing in\\r\\nviolence as they go. He also, about this time, invented the Franklin\\r\\nstove, which in the day when wood was the only fuel consumed has\\r\\ninvested so many firesides with a rare aspect of cheerfulness. He\\r\\nwrote a very ingenious pamphlet, elucidating the philosophy of\\r\\nhouse-warming.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is great moral power in prosperity, when wisely accepted and\\r\\nenjoyed. Franklin was now a prosperous man. His income was constantly\\r\\nincreasing. His virtues, and they were great ones, proved in all\\r\\nrespects promotive of his worldly welfare. His journal was the\\r\\nleading paper, certainly in all that region, and had not its superior\\r\\nin any of the colonies. His renowned almanac, Poor Richard, attained\\r\\nan unexampled sale. The work executed in his printing office was so\\r\\nexcellent as to bring in to him many orders even from the other\\r\\nprovinces. The various books and pamphlets he had published had all\\r\\nbeen successful. Philadelphia had already become the chief town of the\\r\\nColonies.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotwithstanding Franklin\\'s devotion to books, to business, and to\\r\\nphilosophical research, he is represented to have been at this time, a\\r\\njovial man, very fond of convivial gatherings. He could not only write\\r\\na good song, but he could sing it, to the acceptance of his\\r\\ncompanions. One of these songs entitled \"The Old Man\\'s Wish\" he says\\r\\nhe sang over a thousand times. We give the concluding stanza,\\r\\nillustrative of its general character.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"With a courage undaunted, may I face the last day,\\r\\n     And when I am gone may the better sort say,--\\r\\n     In the morning when sober, in the evening when mellow,\\r\\n     He has gone and not left behind him his fellow,\\r\\n     For he governed his passions with absolute sway.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was, as usual, war in Europe. Enormous armies were burning\\r\\ncities and villages, drenching the trampled harvest fields with blood,\\r\\nand filling the humble hamlets of the poor with misery. There was\\r\\nevery reason to fear that these awful storms, raised by the passions\\r\\nof depraved men, would reach the peaceful shores of the Delaware.\\r\\nPhiladelphia was entirely undefended. It is said that there was not an\\r\\navailable cannon in Pennsylvania.\\r\\n\\r\\nA well-armed privateer could at any hour, seize and sack the city.\\r\\nQuaker influence so far prevailed that the legislature could not be\\r\\ninduced to raise a battery, or purchase a gun. Franklin wrote a very\\r\\npowerful pamphlet, called Plain Truth, urging the necessity of\\r\\nadopting some measures of defence. He showed how the colony could, at\\r\\nany time, be ravaged by a few vessels from any European nation then in\\r\\nconflict with England. I give a few extracts from this admirable\\r\\npamphlet:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"On the first alarm, terror will spread over all. Many will\\r\\n     seek safety by flight. Those that are reputed rich will\\r\\n     flee, through fear of torture to make them produce more than\\r\\n     they are able. The man that has a wife and children, will\\r\\n     find them hanging on his neck, beseeching him to quit the\\r\\n     city, and save his life. All will run into confusion, amid\\r\\n     cries and lamentations, and the hurry and disorder of\\r\\n     departures. The few that remain, will be unable to resist.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Sacking the city will be the first; and burning it, in all\\r\\n     probability, the last act of the enemy. This I believe will\\r\\n     be the case, if you have timely notice. But what must be\\r\\n     your condition, if suddenly surprised without previous\\r\\n     alarm, perhaps in the night. Confined to your houses, you\\r\\n     will have nothing to trust but the enemy\\'s mercy. Your best\\r\\n     fortune will be to fall under the power of commanders of\\r\\n     king\\'s ships, able to control the mariners, and not into the\\r\\n     hands of licentious privateers.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Who can without the utmost horror, conceive the miseries of\\r\\n     the latter when your persons, fortunes, wives and daughters,\\r\\n     shall be subject to the wanton and unbridled rage, rapine,\\r\\n     and lust, of negroes, mulattoes, and others, the vilest and\\r\\n     most abandoned of mankind?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis warning effectually roused the community. A public meeting was\\r\\nsummoned, in the immense building erected to accommodate the crowds\\r\\nwho flocked to hear Whitefield. Here Franklin harangued the multitude.\\r\\nAn Association of Defence was organized. Ten thousand persons enrolled\\r\\ntheir names. In a few days nearly every man in the province, who was\\r\\nnot a Quaker, had joined some military organization. Each man\\r\\npurchased for himself a weapon, and was learning how to use it.\\r\\n\\r\\nEighty companies were organized and disciplined. The companies in\\r\\nPhiladelphia united in a regiment, and chose Franklin their colonel.\\r\\nWisely he declined the office, \"conceiving myself unfit,\" he says. A\\r\\nbattery was thrown up below the town. Some cannon were sent for from\\r\\nBoston. Several eighteen-pounders were obtained in New York, and more\\r\\nwere ordered from London. In manning the battery, Franklin took his\\r\\nturn of duty as a common soldier.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was not a little opposition to these measures, but still the\\r\\nstrong current of popular opinion was in their favor. Even the young\\r\\nQuakers, though anxious to avoid wounding the feelings of their\\r\\nparents, secretly gave their influence to these preparations of\\r\\ndefence. The peace of Aix la Chapelle in 1748, terminated these\\r\\nalarms. But the wisdom and energy which Franklin had displayed, caused\\r\\nhim to be regarded as the most prominent man in Pennsylvania. The\\r\\nmasses of the people regarded him with singular homage and confidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1744, Franklin had a daughter born, to whom he gave the name of\\r\\nSarah. His motherless son William, who was destined to give his father\\r\\ngreat trouble, was growing up, stout, idle, and intractable. Early in\\r\\nthe war he had run away, and enlisted on board a privateer. With much\\r\\ndifficulty his father rescued him from these engagements. Franklin was\\r\\nevidently embarrassed to know what to do with the boy. He allowed him,\\r\\nwhen but sixteen years of age, to enlist as a soldier in an\\r\\nexpedition against Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout this time Franklin wrote to his sister Jane, whose son had also\\r\\nrun away to enlist as a privateer. He wished to console her by the\\r\\nassurance that it was not in consequence of unkind treatment, that the\\r\\nboys were induced thus to act. He wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"When boys see prizes brought in, and quantities of money\\r\\n     shared among the men, and their gay living, it fills their\\r\\n     heads with notions that half distract them; and puts them\\r\\n     quite out of conceit with trades and the dull ways of getting\\r\\n     money by working. My only son left my house unknown to us\\r\\n     all, and got on board a privateer, from whence I fetched him.\\r\\n     No one imagined it was hard usage at home that made him do\\r\\n     this. Every one that knows me thinks I am too indulgent a\\r\\n     parent, as well as master.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe father of Benjamin Franklin died in Boston, at the great age of\\r\\neighty-nine years. He had secured, in a very high degree, the respect\\r\\nof the people, not only by his irreproachable morals, but by his\\r\\nunfeigned piety. The Boston News Letter, of January 17, 1745, in the\\r\\nfollowing brief obituary, chronicles his death:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Last night died Mr. Josiah Franklin, tallow chandler, and\\r\\n     soap maker. By the force of steady temperance he had made a\\r\\n     constitution, none of the strongest, last with comfort to the\\r\\n     age of eighty-nine years. And by an entire dependence on his\\r\\n     Redeemer, and a constant course of the strictest piety and\\r\\n     virtue, he was enabled to die as he lived, with cheerfulness\\r\\n     and peace, leaving a numerous posterity the honor of being\\r\\n     descended from a person who, through a long life, supported\\r\\n     the character of an honest man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the year 1743 Franklin drew up a plan for an Academy in\\r\\nPhiladelphia. In consequence of the troubled times the tract was not\\r\\npublished until the year 1749. It was entitled, \"Proposals Relating to\\r\\nthe Education of Youth in Pennsylvania.\" The suggestions he presented\\r\\nindicated a wide acquaintance with the writings of the most eminent\\r\\nphilosophers. He marked out minutely, and with great wisdom, the\\r\\ncourse of study to be pursued. It is pleasant to read the following\\r\\nstatement, in this programme. Urging the study of History, he writes,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"History will also afford frequent opportunities of showing\\r\\n     the necessity of a _public religion_, from its usefulness to\\r\\n     the public; the advantages of a religious character among\\r\\n     private persons; the mischiefs of superstition and the\\r\\n     excellency of the _Christian religion_ above all others,\\r\\n     ancient and modern.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps this tribute to the excellence of Christianity ought in some\\r\\ndegree to modify the impression left upon the mind, by Franklin\\'s\\r\\nstudious avoidal, in all his writings, of any allusion to the name of\\r\\nJesus Christ its founder.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwenty-five thousand dollars were speedily raised for this\\r\\ninstitution. All the religious sects harmoniously united. One\\r\\nindividual from each sect was appointed, to form the corporate body\\r\\nintrusted with the funds. But almost the entire care and trouble of\\r\\nrearing the building, and organizing the institution fell upon\\r\\nFranklin. He was found to be fully adequate to all these\\r\\nresponsibilities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The Tradesman becomes a Philosopher._\\r\\n\\r\\n     Franklin appointed Indian commissioner--Effects of\\r\\n     Rum--Indian logic--Accumulating honors--Benevolent\\r\\n     enterprises--Franklin\\'s counsel to Tennent--Efforts for city\\r\\n     improvement--Anecdotes--Franklin appointed\\r\\n     postmaster--Rumors of War--England enlists the Six Nations\\r\\n     in her cause--Franklin plans a Confederacy of States--Plans\\r\\n     rejected--Electrical experiments--Franklin\\'s increase of\\r\\n     income--Fearful experiments--The kite--New honors--Views of\\r\\n     the French philosopher--Franklin\\'s Religious views--His\\r\\n     counsel to a young pleader--Post-office Reforms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the year 1740, Franklin, then forty-four years of age, was\\r\\nappointed on a commission to form a treaty with the Indians at\\r\\nCarlisle. Franklin, knowing the frenzy to which the savages were\\r\\nplunged by intoxication, promised them that, if they would keep\\r\\nentirely sober until the treaty was concluded, they should then have\\r\\nan ample supply of rum. The agreement was made and faithfully kept.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"They then,\" writes Franklin, \"claimed and received the rum.\\r\\n     This was in the afternoon. They were near one hundred men,\\r\\n     women and children, and were lodged in temporary cabins,\\r\\n     built in the form of a square, just without the town. In the\\r\\n     evening, hearing a great noise among them, the commissioners\\r\\n     walked to see what was the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"We found that they had made a great bonfire in the middle of\\r\\n     the square; that they were all drunk, men and women\\r\\n     quarreling and fighting. Their dark-colored bodies,\\r\\n     half-naked, seen only by the gloomy light of the bonfire,\\r\\n     running after and beating one another with firebrands,\\r\\n     accompanied by their horrid yellings, formed a scene the most\\r\\n     resembling our ideas of hell, that could well be imagined.\\r\\n     There was no appeasing the tumult, and we returned to our\\r\\n     lodgings. At midnight a number of them came thundering at our\\r\\n     door demanding more rum, of which we took no notice.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The next morning they all seemed very much ashamed of the\\r\\n     disgraceful orgies in which they had indulged. There was a\\r\\n     law written in their own hearts, which told them that they\\r\\n     had done wrong. Three chiefs were appointed to call upon the\\r\\n     commissioners with an humble apology. With downcast looks\\r\\n     they confessed their fault, and then with logic which more\\r\\n     intelligent men sometimes use, endeavored to throw the blame\\r\\n     upon God. In remarkable speech one of them said,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"\\'The Great Spirit, who made all things, made everything for\\r\\n     some use. Whatever use he designed anything for, that use it\\r\\n     should be always put to. Now, when he made rum, he said, \"Let\\r\\n     this be for the Indians to get drunk with! and it must be\\r\\n     so.\"\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Governor at this time appointed Franklin a Justice of Peace.\\r\\nFranklin says he was much flattered by these accumulating honors. Soon\\r\\nhe was elected to a seat, as one of the Legislators in the Assembly.\\r\\nMainly through his influence, a hospital for the sick was established\\r\\nin Philadelphia. Though the measure encountered much opposition, he\\r\\ncarried it; and the institution proved of incalculable benefit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rev. Gilbert Tennent solicited Franklin\\'s aid in raising money for\\r\\nbuilding a Meeting House. As Franklin had been so continually engaged\\r\\nin asking for money for various objects of benevolence, he was afraid\\r\\nhe should become obnoxious to his fellow-citizens, and declined. Mr.\\r\\nTennent then requested him to give him a list of the names of those\\r\\ninfluential persons upon whom it would be well for him to call. Every\\r\\nChristian minister who reads this, will appreciate the nature of his\\r\\nembarrassment. Franklin says that he thought it would be unbecoming in\\r\\nhim, after having emptied the purses of his friends, to send other\\r\\nbeggars to them, with renewed importunities. This request he therefore\\r\\ndeclined. Mr. Tennent then urged him to give him some advice.\\r\\nFranklin replied,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That I will willingly do. In the first place, I advise you to apply\\r\\nto all those who you know will do something; next, to those who you\\r\\nare uncertain whether they will give anything or not, and show them\\r\\nthe list of those who have given; and lastly, do not neglect those who\\r\\nyou are sure will give nothing, for in some of them you may be\\r\\nmistaken.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Tennent laughed heartily, and declared that he would rigorously\\r\\nfollow out this advice. He did so. His success was wonderful; a much\\r\\nlarger sum was raised than he had anticipated, and soon a capacious\\r\\nand beautiful Meeting House rose in Arch street.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe streets of Philadelphia, though laid out with great regularity,\\r\\nwere unpaved, and in wet weather were almost impassable quagmires.\\r\\nFranklin, by talking with his friends, and by urging the subject in\\r\\nhis paper, at length succeeded in having a sidewalk paved with stone,\\r\\nupon one of the most important streets. It gave great satisfaction,\\r\\nbut the rest of the street not being paved, the mud was thrown by\\r\\npassing carriages upon it, and as the city employed no street\\r\\ncleaners, the sidewalk soon ceased to afford a clean passage to\\r\\npedestrians.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin found an industrious man who was willing to sweep the\\r\\npavement twice a week, carrying off the dirt from before all the\\r\\ndoors, for the sum of sixpence a month, to be paid by each house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe philosophic Franklin then, having started this enterprise, printed\\r\\non a sheet of paper the great advantages of keeping the sidewalk\\r\\nclean, and sent one of these papers to each house. He urged that much\\r\\nof the soiling of the interior of the houses would thus be avoided,\\r\\nthat an attractive sidewalk would lure passengers to the shops; and\\r\\nthat, in windy weather, their goods would be preserved from the dust.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a few days he called, in person, at each house and shop to see\\r\\nwho would subscribe sixpence a month. It was a great success. The\\r\\ncleanliness of the pavement in the important streets surrounding the\\r\\nmarket, greatly delighted the people, and prepared the way for\\r\\ncarrying a bill which Franklin presented to the Assembly for paving\\r\\nand lighting all the important streets of the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nA gentleman, by the name of John Clifton, had placed a lamp before his\\r\\ndoor. This suggested the idea. Lamps were sent for from London. Globes\\r\\nwere furnished. They were expensive. The smoke circulated in the globe\\r\\nand obstructed the light. They had to be wiped clean each day. An\\r\\naccidental stroke demolished the whole globe. Franklin suggested four\\r\\nflat panes. One might be broken, and easily replaced. Crevices were\\r\\nleft below to admit a current of air, and a funnel to draw off the\\r\\nsmoke. Thus for a long time the glass remained undimmed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWherever Franklin went, he carried with him this spirit of\\r\\nimprovement. When in London, he found the streets wretchedly dirty.\\r\\nOne morning he found a poor woman at his door in Craven street,\\r\\nsweeping the sidewalk with a wretched broom. Her pallid and exhausted\\r\\nappearance touched the sympathies of Franklin. He asked who employed\\r\\nher. She replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nobody. I am poor and in distress. I sweeps before gentlefolks\\'s\\r\\ndoors, and hopes they will give me something.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin immediately engaged her to sweep the whole street. It was\\r\\nnine o\\'clock in the morning. She was so languid and debilitated that\\r\\nhe thought it would take her nearly all day. But in three hours she\\r\\ncame for her shilling. Franklin thought she could not have done her\\r\\nwork faithfully. He sent his servant to examine. He reported that the\\r\\nwork was thoroughly done. A new problem rose before Franklin: If this\\r\\nfeeble woman could in so short a time sweep such a street, a strong\\r\\nman, with a suitable broom, could certainly do it in half of the\\r\\ntime. He therefore drew up a plan for cleaning the streets of London\\r\\nand Westminster, which was placed in the hands of one of the most\\r\\ninfluential of the public-spirited men of London.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin apologizes for speaking in his autobiography of such trifles.\\r\\nVery truly, he says,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Human felicity is produced not so much by great pieces of\\r\\n     good fortune that seldom happen, as by little advantages\\r\\n     that occur every day. Thus if you teach a poor young man to\\r\\n     shave himself and keep his razor in order, you may\\r\\n     contribute more to the happiness of his life than in giving\\r\\n     him a thousand guineas. This sum may be soon spent, the\\r\\n     regret only remaining of having foolishly consumed it. But\\r\\n     in the other case, he escapes the frequent vexation of\\r\\n     waiting for barbers, and of their sometimes dirty fingers,\\r\\n     offensive breath, and dull razors. He shaves when most\\r\\n     convenient to him, and enjoys daily the pleasure of its\\r\\n     being done with a good instrument.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly all the important offices in the colonies were filled by\\r\\nappointments from the British Crown. For some time, Franklin had been\\r\\nemployed as an assistant to the Postmaster General, in simplifying and\\r\\nbringing regularity into his accounts. Upon the death of the American\\r\\nPostmaster, Franklin, in 1753, was appointed jointly with Sir William\\r\\nHunter to succeed him. The appointment was made by the Postmaster\\r\\nGeneral in England.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe post-office department had scarcely been self-supporting. It had\\r\\nnever paid anything to the crown. The salary offered to the two\\r\\npostmasters was three thousand dollars a year each, if they could save\\r\\nthat sum from the profits of the office. Franklin writes,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"To do this a variety of improvements was necessary. Some of\\r\\n     these were inevitably, at first, expensive; so that in the\\r\\n     first four years, the office became above nine hundred\\r\\n     pounds in debt to us. But it soon after began to repay us.\\r\\n     And before I was displaced by a freak of the ministers, of\\r\\n     which I shall hereafter speak, we had brought it to yield\\r\\n     three times as much clear revenue to the crown as the\\r\\n     post-office of Ireland. Since that imprudent transaction,\\r\\n     they have received from it not one farthing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain there were menaces of war, insane and demoniac, to fill the\\r\\nworld with tears and woe. As we read the record of these horrid\\r\\noutrages which through all the centuries have desolated this globe, it\\r\\nwould seem that there must be a vein of insanity as well as of\\r\\ndepravity, in the heart of fallen man. England and France were again\\r\\nmarshaling their armies, and accumulating their fleets, for the\\r\\nterrible conflict.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was certain that France, in Canada, and England, in her colonies,\\r\\ncould not live in peace here, while the volcanic throes of war were\\r\\nshaking the island of Great Britain, and the Continent of Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the heart of New York, then almost an unbroken wilderness, there\\r\\nwere six exceedingly fierce and war-like tribes called the Six\\r\\nNations. Like the wolves they delighted in war. The greatness of a man\\r\\ndepended on the number of scalps with which he could fringe his dress.\\r\\nThese savage warriors were ready and eager to engage as the allies of\\r\\nthose who would pay them the highest price. Mercy was an attribute of\\r\\nwhich they knew not even the name.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not doubted that France would immediately send her emissaries\\r\\nfrom Canada to enlist these savages on her side. Awful would be the\\r\\nwoes with which these demoniac men could sweep our defenceless\\r\\nfrontiers; with the tomahawk and the scalping knife, exterminating\\r\\nfamilies, burning villages, and loading their pack-horses with\\r\\nplunder. To forestall the French, and to turn these woes from our own\\r\\nfrontier to the humble homes of the Canadian emigrants, the English\\r\\ngovernment appointed a commissioner to visit the chiefs of these\\r\\ntribes in the year 1754.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe all important council was to be held in Albany. Governor Hamilton\\r\\nappointed four commissioners, of whom Franklin was one, to act in\\r\\nbehalf of Pennsylvania. They were furnished with rich gifts with which\\r\\nto purchase the favor of the Indians. It was a long and tedious\\r\\njourney from Philadelphia to Albany.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin, on this journey, was deeply impressed with the importance of\\r\\na union of the colonies for self-defence. He therefore drew up a plan\\r\\nfor such union. Several gentlemen of the highest intelligence in New\\r\\nYork, having examined it, gave it their cordial approval. He\\r\\naccordingly laid it before Congress.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were several other persons in other colonies who were impressed\\r\\nas deeply as Franklin with a sense of the importance of such a\\r\\nconfederacy, and they also sent in their suggestions.\\r\\n\\r\\nCongress appointed a committee of one from each province, to consider\\r\\nthe several plans. The committee approved of Franklin\\'s plan, and\\r\\nreported accordingly. While the commissioners were conferring with the\\r\\nIndians in Albany, Congress was engaged in discussing the plans of a\\r\\nconfederacy. Franklin\\'s plan was finally rejected. It did not meet the\\r\\nviews either of the Assembly, or of the British Court. And here we\\r\\nsee, perhaps the germs of the great conflict which soon culminated in\\r\\nthe cruel war of the Revolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Assembly objected to the plan as too aristocratic, conferring too\\r\\nmuch power upon the crown. The court emphatically rejected it as too\\r\\ndemocratic, investing the people with too much power. Franklin ever\\r\\naffirmed that his plan was the true medium. Even the royalist governor\\r\\nof Pennsylvania warmly commended the compromise he urged.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn visiting Boston he was shown an electric tube, recently sent from\\r\\nEngland. With this tube some very surprising electrical experiments\\r\\nwere performed, ushering in a new science, of which then but very\\r\\nlittle was known. Franklin became intensely interested in the subject.\\r\\nUpon his return to Philadelphia, he devoted himself, with great\\r\\nassiduity, to experimenting with electric tubes. At this time he wrote\\r\\nto a friend,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I never was before engaged in any study that so totally\\r\\n     engrossed my attention and my time, as this has lately done;\\r\\n     for what with making experiments when I can be alone, and\\r\\n     repeating them to my friends and acquaintances, who, from\\r\\n     the novelty of the thing, come continually in crowds to see\\r\\n     them, I have little leisure for anything else.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was during the winter of 1746-7. Franklin suggested that the\\r\\nelectricity was collected, not created by friction. He also\\r\\npropounded the theory of positive and negative electricity. He was, at\\r\\nthis time, comparatively a wealthy man, and consequently could afford\\r\\nto devote his time to philosophical investigation. It is estimated\\r\\nthat his income, from his estates, amounted to about seven hundred\\r\\npounds a year; this was equal to about six or seven thousand dollars\\r\\nat the present time. Mr. Parton writes,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Besides this independence, Franklin was the holder of two\\r\\n     offices, worth together perhaps one hundred and fifty pounds\\r\\n     a year. His business, then more flourishing than ever,\\r\\n     produced an annual profit, as before computed, of two\\r\\n     thousand pounds; bringing up his income to the troublesome\\r\\n     and absurd amount of nearly three thousand pounds; three\\r\\n     times the revenue of a colonial governor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder these prosperous circumstances, Franklin withdrew from active\\r\\nbusiness, became a silent partner in the firm, and devoted nearly all\\r\\nhis time to the new science. He wrote, in the autumn of 1748, to his\\r\\nfriend Cadwallader Colden of New York,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I have removed to a more quiet part of the town, where I am\\r\\n     settling my old accounts, and hope soon to be quite master\\r\\n     of my own time, and no longer, as the song has it, \\'at every\\r\\n     one\\'s call but my own.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Thus you see I am in a fair way of having no other tasks\\r\\n     than such as I shall like to give myself, and of enjoying\\r\\n     what I look upon as a great happiness, leisure to read,\\r\\n     study, make experiments, and converse at large with such\\r\\n     ingenious and worthy men, as are pleased to honor me with\\r\\n     their friendship or acquaintance, on such points as may\\r\\n     produce something for the common benefit of mankind,\\r\\n     uninterrupted by the cares and fatigues of business.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe wrote a treatise upon thundergusts, which displayed wonderful\\r\\nsagacity, and which arrested the attention of nearly all the\\r\\nphilosophers in Europe and America. The all-important topics of this\\r\\nexceedingly important document, were the power of points to draw off\\r\\nelectricity, and also the similarity of electricity and lightning. He\\r\\ntherefore urged that metallic rods might be attached to buildings and\\r\\nships, which, pushing their needle points above roofs and masts, might\\r\\ndraw the electric fire harmlessly from the clouds. He confesses that\\r\\nhe cannot imagine why the points should possess this curious power,\\r\\nbut urges that facts seem to demonstrate it.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, for the entertainment of his friends, he had made\\r\\narrangements to kill a turkey with an electric shock. Two large jars\\r\\nwere heavily charged. Incautiously manipulating, he took the shock\\r\\nhimself. In the following language, he describes the effect:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The flash was very great, and the crack was as loud as a\\r\\n     pistol; yet my senses being instantly gone, I neither saw\\r\\n     the one nor heard the other; nor did I feel the stroke on my\\r\\n     hand, though I afterwards found it raised a round swelling\\r\\n     where the fire entered, as big as half a pistol bullet.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I then felt what I know not well how to describe, a\\r\\n     universal blow throughout my whole body from head to foot,\\r\\n     which seemed within as well as without; after which the\\r\\n     first thing I took notice of was a violent, quick shaking of\\r\\n     my body, which gradually remitting, my sense as gradually\\r\\n     returned, and then, I thought the bottle must be discharged,\\r\\n     but could not conceive how, till at last I perceived the\\r\\n     chain in my hand, and recollected what I had been about to\\r\\n     do.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"That part of my hand and fingers which held the chain, was\\r\\n     left white as though the blood had been driven out; and\\r\\n     remained so eight or ten minutes after, feeling like dead\\r\\n     flesh; and I had numbness in my arms and the back of my neck\\r\\n     which continued to the next morning, but wore off.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin was much mortified at his awkwardness in this experiment. He\\r\\ndeclared it to be a notorious blunder, and compared it with the folly\\r\\nof the Irishman, who wishing to steal some gun-powder, bored a hole\\r\\nthrough the cask with red hot iron. But notwithstanding this warning,\\r\\nnot long afterwards, in endeavoring to give a shock to a paralytic\\r\\npatient, he received the whole charge himself, and was knocked flat\\r\\nand senseless on the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the spring of 1752, Franklin tried his world renowned experiment\\r\\nwith the kite. A June thunder cloud was rising in all its majesty.\\r\\nFranklin, accompanied by his son, repaired to a field secretly, being\\r\\nafraid of the ridicule of the people. Here he raised the kite, made of\\r\\na large silk handkerchief. The top of the perpendicular stick was\\r\\npointed with a sharp metallic rod. The string was hemp with the\\r\\nexception of the part held in the hand, which was silk; at the end of\\r\\nthe hempen string a common key was suspended. With intense anxiety and\\r\\nno slight apprehension of danger, he held the line. Soon he observed\\r\\nthe fibres of the hempen string to rise and separate themselves, as\\r\\nwas the case of the hair on the head, when any one was placed on an\\r\\ninsulating stool. He applied his knuckle to the key, and received an\\r\\nunmistakable spark. As the story is generally told, with occasionally\\r\\nslight contradictions, he applied his knuckle again and again to the\\r\\nkey with a similar result. He charged a Leyden jar with the fluid and\\r\\nboth he and his son took a shock. He then drew in his kite, packed up\\r\\nhis apparatus and returned to his laboratory probably the most\\r\\nexultant and happy man in this wide world.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the English and many of the French philosophers were very\\r\\nunwilling to believe that an obscure American, in what they deemed the\\r\\nsavage and uncultivated wilds of the New World, was outstripping them\\r\\nin philosophical research. They were unwilling to acknowledge the\\r\\nreality of his experiments; but in France, where an American would\\r\\nreceive more impartial treatment, three of the most eminent\\r\\nphilosophers, Count de Buffon, M. Dalibard and M. de Lor, at different\\r\\nplaces, raised the apparatus Franklin had recommended to draw\\r\\nelectricity from the clouds. Their success was unmistakable; the\\r\\nresults of these experiments were proclaimed throughout Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin had now obtained renown. No one could deny that he merited a\\r\\nhigh position among the most eminent philosophers. The experiments he\\r\\nhad suggested were tried by scientists in the philosophical circles of\\r\\nevery country in Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Yale and Harvard, in this country, conferred upon him the\\r\\nhonorary degree of Master of Arts, and the Royal Society, in Europe,\\r\\nby a unanimous vote, elected him a member, remitting the usual\\r\\ninitiation fee of five guineas, and the annual charge of two and a\\r\\nhalf guineas. The next year this Society conferred upon him the Copley\\r\\nmedal.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor seven years Franklin continued to devote himself almost\\r\\nexclusively to this science, and he became, without doubt, the most\\r\\naccomplished electrician in the world. At the same time his mind was\\r\\never active in devising new schemes for the welfare of humanity. The\\r\\nmost trivial events would often suggest to him measures conducive to\\r\\nthe most beneficial results. It is said that Franklin saw one day in a\\r\\nditch the fragments of a basket of yellow willow, in which some\\r\\nforeign commodity had been imported to this country. One of the twigs\\r\\nhad sprouted. He planted it; and it became the parent of all the\\r\\nyellow willows in our country.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin was best loved where he was best known. And this was right;\\r\\nfor he was ever conferring deeds of kindness upon his neighbors. His\\r\\nreligious views excited sorrow among his Christian friends. Others,\\r\\ncomposing perhaps a majority, cared nothing about what he believed. In\\r\\nconversation he ever frankly avowed himself a deist, though generally\\r\\nhe made no attempt to convert others to his views. It is not\\r\\nimprobable that he was in some degree influenced by the beneficial\\r\\neffect produced upon the popular mind by the preaching of his friend\\r\\nMr. Whitefield.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe writer was once, in Paris, conversing with one of the most\\r\\nillustrious of the French philosophers. He said to the philosopher, \"I\\r\\nam much interested to ascertain the views of gentlemen of your\\r\\nintellectual position respecting the Christian religion.\" He with\\r\\nperfect frankness replied, \"I think that there are no men of high\\r\\nculture in France, with a few exceptions, who believe in the divine\\r\\norigin of Christianity. But there is no philanthropist who will say\\r\\nso. We have been taught, by the horrors of the French Revolution, that\\r\\nthe masses of the people can only be restrained from violence by the\\r\\nsuperstitious restraints which Christianity presents. We therefore\\r\\nthink that every man, who is a gentleman, will do what he can to\\r\\nsustain the church and the clergy. Men of culture and refinement, are\\r\\ngoverned by principles of honor, and they do not need the\\r\\nsuperstitious motives of Christianity to influence them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI may remark, in passing, that this gentlemanly philosopher had\\r\\nabandoned his own wife, and was then living with the wife of another\\r\\nman. It is not improbable that Franklin, as he looked upon the\\r\\ntumultuous and passion-tossed young men of Philadelphia, did not deem\\r\\nit expedient to say to them,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Bible is a fable. The Sabbath is no more sacred than any other\\r\\nday. The church is merely a human club without any divine authority.\\r\\nMarriage is an institution which is not founded upon any decree which\\r\\nGod has issued, but one of the expediency of which each individual\\r\\nmust judge for himself. The Sacraments of Baptism, and the Lord\\'s\\r\\nSupper, are mere human contrivances. The preaching of the Gospel had\\r\\nbetter be laid aside for literary and scientific disquisitions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the eye of a benevolent philosopher, Franklin, as we have seen,\\r\\nhad watched the effect of the preaching of Mr. Whitefield, and had\\r\\ncandidly acknowledged its power in reforming society. It is improbable\\r\\nthat, in his heart, he felt that the preaching of pure deism could\\r\\never secure such results. In 1753 he wrote to Mr. Whitefield, in reply\\r\\nto a communication from him upon the Christian faith:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The faith you mention certainly has its use in the world. I\\r\\n     do not desire to see it diminished, nor would I endeavor to\\r\\n     lessen it in any man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin had resolved to decline all office, that he might devote\\r\\nhimself to his studies. But his reputation for wisdom was such, that\\r\\nhe found it very difficult to persevere in this plan. Menaces of war\\r\\nwere continually arising. The majority of the members, in the\\r\\nAssembly, were Quakers. It was a small body consisting of but forty\\r\\ndelegates. The Quakers opposed every measure for public defence.\\r\\nFranklin, as we have mentioned, became a Justice of the Peace. Soon\\r\\nafter he was an Alderman, and then he took his seat in the General\\r\\nAssembly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was a bad speaker,\" he writes, \"never eloquent; subject to much\\r\\nhesitation in the choice of words; and yet I generally carried my\\r\\npoint.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe adds, in language which every young man should treasure up in his\\r\\nmemory, \"I retained the habit of expressing myself in terms of modest\\r\\ndiffidence; never using, when I advanced anything that might possibly\\r\\nbe disputed, the words, _certainly_, _undoubtedly_, or any others that\\r\\ngive the air of positiveness to an opinion; but rather, I _conceive_,\\r\\nor _apprehend_ a thing to be so and so. _It appears to me_, or, _I\\r\\nshould not think it so for such and such reasons_, or, _I imagine it\\r\\nto be so_, or, _It is so if I am not mistaken_. This habit, I believe,\\r\\nhas been of great advantage to me when I have had occasion to\\r\\ninculcate my opinions; and to persuade men into measures that I have\\r\\nbeen from time to time proposing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Franklin assumed the charge of the post-office, the department\\r\\nwas in a feeble and peculiar condition. As late as the year 1757, the\\r\\nmail-bag in Virginia was passed from planter to planter. Each one was\\r\\nrequired to forward it promptly, under the penalty of forfeiting a\\r\\nhogshead of tobacco. Every man took, from the bag, what belonged to\\r\\nhis family, and sent on the rest. The line of post-offices then\\r\\nextended from Boston, Mass., to Charleston, S. C. It was twenty years\\r\\nafter this, before any governmental mail penetrated the interior.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the year 1753, Franklin visited every post-office excepting that\\r\\nof Charleston. His wisdom introduced reforms, some of which have\\r\\ncontinued to the present day. A newspaper was charged nine pence\\r\\na year, for a distance of fifty miles, and eighteen pence for\\r\\none hundred miles or more. In the large towns a penny post was\\r\\nestablished, and all letters left remaining in the office were\\r\\nadvertised.\\r\\n\\r\\nA mail was conveyed from Philadelphia to New York once a week in\\r\\nsummer, and once in two weeks in winter. Franklin started a mail to\\r\\nleave each of these cities three times a week in summer, and twice in\\r\\nwinter. It generally required six weeks to obtain an answer from a\\r\\nletter sent to Boston. Most of the roads, into the interior, consisted\\r\\nof narrow passages, cut through the forest, called Bridle Paths,\\r\\nbecause the pack horses were led through them, in single file by the\\r\\nbridle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The Rising Storms of War._\\r\\n\\r\\n     Aristocracy--Anecdote--Conflicting laws of\\r\\n     Nations--Franklin\\'s scheme of colonization--Proposal of the\\r\\n     British Court--The foresight of Franklin--Braddock\\'s\\r\\n     campaign--Remonstrances of Franklin and\\r\\n     Washington--Franklin\\'s interviews with Braddock--Franklin\\'s\\r\\n     efficiency--Confidence of Braddock--The conflict with the\\r\\n     Proprietaries--The non-resistant Quakers--Fate of the\\r\\n     Moravian villages--The winter campaign--The camp of\\r\\n     Gaudenhutton--Anecdote--Renewal of the strife with the\\r\\n     Proprietaries--Franklin recalled to assist the\\r\\n     Assembly--Destruction of the Fort--Claim of the\\r\\n     Proprietaries--The great controversy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWith increasing wealth the spirit of aristocratic exclusiveness gained\\r\\nstrength in the higher circles of Philadelphia. Some of the more\\r\\nopulent families planned for a series of dancing entertainments during\\r\\nthe winter. It was proposed among other rules that no mechanic, or\\r\\nmechanic\\'s wife or daughter, should be invited. The rules were shown\\r\\nto Franklin. He glanced his eye over them and pithily remarked,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why these rules would exclude God Almighty!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How so?\" inquired the manager.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because,\" Franklin replied, \"the Almighty, as all know, is the\\r\\ngreatest mechanic in the universe. In six days he made all things.\"\\r\\nThe obnoxious article was stricken out.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following incident, narrated by Franklin, illustrates a very\\r\\nimportant principle in political economy, which those are apt to\\r\\nignore, who denounce all the elegancies and luxuries of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Franklin received some small favor from the captain of a little\\r\\ncoaster, which ran between Cape May and Philadelphia. He declined to\\r\\nreceive any remuneration for his trifling services. Mrs. Franklin,\\r\\nlearning that he had a pretty daughter, sent her a new-fashioned\\r\\nPhiladelphia cap or bonnet. Three years after, the captain called\\r\\nagain at the house of Mr. Franklin. A very plain but intelligent\\r\\nfarmer accompanied him. The captain expressed his thanks to Mrs.\\r\\nFranklin for the gift she had sent his daughter, and rather\\r\\ndiscourteously added,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it proved a dear cap to our congregation. When my daughter\\r\\nappeared with it at meeting, it was so much admired that all the girls\\r\\nresolved to get such caps from Philadelphia. And my wife and I\\r\\ncomputed that the whole could not have cost less than a hundred\\r\\npounds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe farmer, with far higher intelligence, said, \"This is true; but\\r\\nyou do not tell the whole story. I think the cap was nevertheless an\\r\\nadvantage to us. It was the first thing that put our girls upon\\r\\nknitting worsted mittens, for sale at Philadelphia, that they might\\r\\nhave wherewithal to buy caps and ribbons there. And you know that that\\r\\nindustry has continued and is likely to continue and increase, to a\\r\\nmuch greater value, and answer better purposes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thus by a profitable exchange, the industrious girls at Cape May had\\r\\npretty bonnets, and the girls at Philadelphia had warm mittens.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor seventy-five years it had been the constant design of the British\\r\\ngovernment to drive the French from North America. England claimed the\\r\\nwhole country, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, because her ships had\\r\\nfirst sailed along the Atlantic coast. It was one of the recognized\\r\\nlaws of nations that a newly discovered region belonged to the nation\\r\\nwho had first raised upon it its flag.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrance, admitting the claim of England to the Atlantic coast, asserted\\r\\nher right to the great valleys of the interior, those of the Ohio and\\r\\nthe Mississippi, because her boatmen had first discovered those\\r\\nmagnificent rivers, had explored them throughout, and had established\\r\\nupon them her trading and military posts. It was a recognized law of\\r\\nnations, that the power which discovered, explored, and took\\r\\npossession of a new river, was the rightful possessor of the valley\\r\\nwhich that river watered. Thus the conflict of claims originated.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo add to the intensity of the insane strife, which caused an amount\\r\\nof blood and misery which no tongue can tell, religious bitterness was\\r\\naroused, and the French Roman Catholic was arrayed against the British\\r\\nProtestant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree wars, bloody and woful, had already ravaged this continent. We\\r\\nhave before alluded to the menace of a new war in the year 1754, and\\r\\nto Franklin\\'s mission to Albany to enlist the chiefs of the Six\\r\\nNations to become allies of the English. We have also alluded to the\\r\\nplan, which Franklin drew up on this journey, for the union of the\\r\\ncolonies, and which was rejected. The wisdom of this plan was,\\r\\nhowever, subsequently developed by the fact that it was remarkably\\r\\nlike that by which eventually the colonies were bound together as a\\r\\nnation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAssuming that the English were right in their claim for the whole\\r\\ncontinent, Franklin urged the eminently wise measure of establishing\\r\\nstrong colonies, in villages of a hundred families each, on the\\r\\nluxuriant banks of the western rivers. But the haughty British\\r\\ngovernment would receive no instructions from American provincials.\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernor Shirley, of Boston, showed Mr. Franklin a plan, drawn up in\\r\\nEngland, for conducting the war. It developed consummate ignorance of\\r\\nthe difficulties of carrying on war in the pathless wilderness; and\\r\\nalso a great disregard of the political rights of the American\\r\\ncitizens. According to this document, the British court was to\\r\\noriginate and execute all the measures for the conduct of the war; and\\r\\nthe British Parliament was to assess whatever tax it deemed expedient\\r\\nupon the American people to defray the expenses. The Americans were to\\r\\nhave no representation in Parliament, and no voice whatever in\\r\\ndeciding upon the sum which they were to pay.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin examined the document carefully, and returned it with his\\r\\nwritten objections. In this remarkable paper, he anticipated the\\r\\narguments which our most distinguished statesmen and logicians urged\\r\\nagainst the Stamp Act--against Taxation without Representation. A\\r\\nbrief extract from this important paper, will give the reader some\\r\\nidea of its character:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The colonists are Englishmen. The accident of living in a\\r\\n     colony deprives them of no right secured by Magna Charta. The\\r\\n     people in the colonies, who are to feel the immediate\\r\\n     mischiefs of invasion and conquest by an enemy, in the loss\\r\\n     of their estates, lives and liberties, are likely to be\\r\\n     better judges of the quantity of forces necessary to be\\r\\n     raised and maintained, and supported, and of their own\\r\\n     ability to bear the expense, than the Parliament of England,\\r\\n     at so great a distance. Compelling the colonists to pay money\\r\\n     without their consent, would be rather like raising\\r\\n     contributions in an enemy\\'s country, than taxing of\\r\\n     Englishmen for their own public benefit. It would be treating\\r\\n     them as a conquered people, and not as true British\\r\\n     subjects.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length the brave, but self-conceited and haughty General Braddock\\r\\ncame with his army of British Regulars. Frenchmen, Indians, and\\r\\nAmericans, he alike regarded with contempt. His troops were\\r\\nrendezvoused at Fredericktown, in Maryland. A bridle path led through\\r\\nthe wilderness to this place, from Philadelphia, a distance of a\\r\\nhundred and twenty miles.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntelligent American gentlemen were much alarmed, by the reckless and\\r\\nperilous measures which the ignorant British general declared his\\r\\nintention to pursue. He became very angry with Pennsylvanians, because\\r\\nthey were so unwilling to fall in with his plans. It was said that, in\\r\\nhis anger, he manifested more desire to ravage Pennsylvania than to\\r\\ndefeat the French.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Assembly at Philadelphia appointed a commission, consisting of\\r\\nBenjamin Franklin and his son, a resolute, insubordinate man of thirty\\r\\nyears, and of the Governors of New York and Massachusetts, to visit\\r\\nthe arrogant British officer, and to endeavor, in some way, to\\r\\ninfluence him to wiser measures. It was the middle of April, a\\r\\nbeautiful season in that climate, of swelling buds, and opening\\r\\nleaves.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach of the four gentlemen was attended by servants, as was customary\\r\\nin those days. They were all finely mounted. Joyfully they rode along,\\r\\nseeking entertainment each night at the residence of some planter. A\\r\\ncourier was always sent forward to announce their coming, and the\\r\\nplanter, accompanied by one or two of his servants, would generally\\r\\nride forward a few miles to meet them, and escort them to his\\r\\nhospitable home.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin was received by Gen. Braddock with the condescension with\\r\\nwhich, in that day, English gentlemen were ever accustomed to regard\\r\\nAmericans of whatever name or note. The little army, which was to\\r\\nmarch upon Fort Duquesne, was to traverse the dreary and pathless\\r\\nridges and ravines of the Alleghany mountains, and force their way\\r\\nthrough a tangled wilderness, for a distance of several hundred miles.\\r\\nDuring all this march they were hourly exposed to be attacked by an\\r\\noverpowering force of French and Indians. The French could easily\\r\\ndescend to the Ohio, in their boats from Canada, and nearly all the\\r\\nIndians of this vast interior, were in alliance with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBraddock insisted upon encumbering his march with heavily laden\\r\\nwagons, which were to penetrate savage regions through which he must,\\r\\nevery mile, construct his road. There was a young American in the camp\\r\\nby the name of George Washington. He was a man of the highest rank,\\r\\nand of commanding influence, having obtained much experience in Indian\\r\\nwarfare. Modestly, but warmly, he remonstrated against this folly. He\\r\\nnot only feared, but was fully assured that such a measure would lead\\r\\nto the inevitable destruction of the army. He urged that pack horses\\r\\nonly should be employed, and as few of them as possible; and that thus\\r\\nthey should hurry along as rapidly and in as compact a mass as they\\r\\ncould.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Braddock was inexorable. He demanded his two hundred and fifty\\r\\nwagons, and a large train of pack horses, to be laden with sumptuous\\r\\nprovisions for his officers. The farmers of Maryland and Virginia were\\r\\nreluctant to expose the few wagons and teams they had, to such\\r\\ninevitable destruction. Neither had they any confidence that the\\r\\nBritish Government would ever remunerate them in case of their loss.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour-wheeled vehicles were very scarce in the colonies. There were\\r\\nmany people who had never seen one. The general, after exhausting all\\r\\nhis efforts, could obtain but twenty-four. One day as he was giving\\r\\nvent to his indignation, Franklin suggested that it would probably be\\r\\nmuch more easy to obtain wagons in the more densely settled parts of\\r\\nPennsylvania. Braddock immediately urged him to undertake the\\r\\nenterprise. Unwisely, we think, he consented. With his son he hastened\\r\\nto Pennsylvania, and selected Lancaster, York, and Carlisle as his\\r\\ncentres of operation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhatever Franklin undertook, he was pretty sure to accomplish. In\\r\\ntwenty days he obtained one hundred and fifty four-horse wagons, and\\r\\ntwo hundred and fifty-nine pack-horses. He did not accomplish this\\r\\nfeat however, until he had exhausted all the money which Braddock had\\r\\nfurnished him, had spent over a thousand dollars of his own money, and\\r\\nhad given bonds for the safe return of horses and wagons, whose money\\r\\nvalue was estimated at one hundred thousand dollars.\\r\\n\\r\\nBraddock was lavish in his compliments. Franklin dined with him daily.\\r\\nThe idea seemed never to have entered Braddock\\'s mind that British\\r\\nRegulars, under his command, could ever be seriously annoyed by bands\\r\\nof French and Indians. He said one day,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After taking Fort Duquesne, I shall go to Niagara. Having taken that,\\r\\nif the season will permit, I shall proceed to Fort Frontenac. Fort\\r\\nDuquesne can hardly detain me more than three or four days.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin, who was well aware that Braddock was entering upon a far\\r\\nmore formidable campaign than he anticipated, ventured very modestly\\r\\nto suggest,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure, sir, if you arrive well before Duquesne with the fine\\r\\ntroops so well provided with artillery, the fort, though completely\\r\\nfortified, and assisted with a very strong garrison, can probably make\\r\\nbut a short resistance. The only danger I apprehend of obstruction to\\r\\nyour march, is of ambuscades of the Indians, who, by constant\\r\\npractice, are dexterous in laying and executing them. And the slender\\r\\nline, near four miles long, which your army must make, may expose it\\r\\nto be attacked by surprise in its flanks, and to be cut like a thread\\r\\ninto several pieces, which, from their distance, cannot come up in\\r\\ntime to support each other.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBraddock smiled derisively, at this ignorance of a benighted American.\\r\\n\"These savages may indeed,\" he said, \"be a formidable enemy to your\\r\\nraw American militia. But upon the king\\'s regular and disciplined\\r\\ntroops, it is impossible that they should make any impression.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Washington regarded the wagons, and the long array of\\r\\npack-horses, as so many nuisances, arresting the rapidity of their\\r\\nmarch, and inviting attacks which it would be impossible to repel. At\\r\\nlength the army was in motion. The progress was very slow. Franklin\\r\\nwas continually forwarding supplies; and even advanced between six and\\r\\nseven thousand dollars, from his own purse, to expedite purchases. A\\r\\npart of this he never received back.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attack upon Braddock\\'s army, and its terrible defeat soon came. A\\r\\nminute account of the conflict is given in the Life of George\\r\\nWashington, one of the volumes of this series. The teamsters cut the\\r\\ntraces of their horses, mounted the swiftest, and, in the frenzy of\\r\\ntheir panic, rushed for home. The other horses and the wagons, with\\r\\ntheir abounding supplies, were left to magnify the triumph of the\\r\\nexultant Indians. Disastrous as was the campaign, Franklin obtained\\r\\nmuch credit for the efficient services he had rendered.\\r\\n\\r\\nWar, with all its horrors, had now penetrated the beautiful region of\\r\\nPennsylvania, which had enjoyed eighty years of peace, through the\\r\\nChristian philanthropy of William Penn. Nearly all of the Indians,\\r\\nbeyond the mountains, were allies of the French. The news of\\r\\nBraddock\\'s defeat reached Philadelphia about the middle of July, 1755.\\r\\nImmediately a violent conflict arose between the royalist governor\\r\\nMorris, and the Colonial Assembly. The Legislative body voted liberal\\r\\ntaxes for the public defence. But very justly it was enacted that\\r\\nthese taxes should be assessed impartially upon all estates alike,\\r\\nupon those of the wealthy Proprietaries, as well as upon the\\r\\nfew hundred acres which were owned by the humble farmers. The\\r\\nProprietaries, consisting of two of the sons of William Penn, revolted\\r\\nagainst this. The Governor, appointed by them, as their agent of\\r\\ncourse, united with them in opposition. For many weeks the conflict\\r\\nbetween the Assembly and the Governor as agent of the Proprietaries,\\r\\nraged fiercely. Under these circumstances no military supplies could\\r\\nbe voted, and the peril of the community was very great.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin warmly espoused and eloquently advocated the claim of the\\r\\nAssembly. During the months of July and August, the Indians, satiated\\r\\nwith the vast plunder of Braddock\\'s camp, made no attempt to cross the\\r\\nAlleghanies, in predatory excursions against the more settled portions\\r\\nof Pennsylvania. But September and October ushered in scenes of horror\\r\\nand carnage, too awful to be depicted. Villages were laid in ashes,\\r\\ncottages were burned, families tomahawked and scalped, women and\\r\\nchildren carried into captivity, and many poor creatures perished at\\r\\nthe stake, in the endurance of all the tortures which savage ingenuity\\r\\ncould devise.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd still the Quakers, adhering to their principle of non-resistance,\\r\\nrefused to contribute any money, or in any way to unite in any\\r\\nmilitary organization for self-defence. But in candor it must be\\r\\nadmitted, that had the principles of the Quakers been adopted by the\\r\\nBritish court, this whole disastrous war might have been avoided. It\\r\\nwas a war of invasion commenced by the English. They were determined,\\r\\nby force of arms, to drive the French out of the magnificent valleys\\r\\nbeyond the mountains. In the conflict which ensued, both parties\\r\\nenlisted all the savages they could, as allies. Will not England at\\r\\nthe judgment be held responsible for this war and its woes?\\r\\n\\r\\nTo rouse the Quakers to a sense of shame, the bodies of a whole\\r\\nmurdered family, mutilated and gory, were brought to Philadelphia and\\r\\nparaded through all its streets, in an open wagon. In November, as the\\r\\nIndians, often led by French officers, were sweeping the frontier in\\r\\nall directions, killing, burning, destroying, the antagonistic parties\\r\\nin the Assembly, for a time laid aside their quarrels, and with the\\r\\nexception of the Quakers, adopted vigorous military measures. The\\r\\nQuakers were generally the most opulent people in the State. It is not\\r\\nstrange that the common people should be reluctant to volunteer to\\r\\ndefend the property of the Quakers, since they refused either to\\r\\nshoulder a musket, or to contribute a dollar.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pen of Franklin rendered wonderful service in this crisis. With\\r\\nhis accustomed toleration, he could make allowance for the frailties\\r\\nof conscience-bound men. He wrote a very witty pamphlet which was very\\r\\nwidely read, and produced a powerful impression. Its character may be\\r\\ninferred from the following brief quotation:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"\\'For my part,\\' says A., \\'I am no coward; but hang me if I\\r\\n     fight to save the Quakers.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"\\'That is to say,\\' B. replied, \\'you will not pump the\\r\\n     sinking ship, because it will save the rats as well as\\r\\n     yourselves.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dialogue ends with the following admirable words:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"O! my friends, the glory of serving and saving others is\\r\\n     superior to the advantage of being served and secured. Let\\r\\n     us resolutely and generously unite in our country\\'s cause,\\r\\n     in which to die is the sweetest of all deaths; and may the\\r\\n     God of armies bless our honest endeavors.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colonists of Pennsylvania now generally rushed to arms. There\\r\\nwere, on the frontiers, several flourishing Moravian villages. They\\r\\nwere occupied by a peculiarly industrious and religious people. The\\r\\ntraveller through their quiet streets heard, morning and evening, the\\r\\nvoice of prayer ascending from many firesides, and the melody of\\r\\nChristian hymns. Guadenhutton, perhaps the most flourishing of them,\\r\\nwas attacked by the Indians, burned, and the inhabitants all massacred\\r\\nor carried into captivity. Terrible was the panic in the other\\r\\nvillages. They were liable at any day, to experience the same fate.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder these circumstances the Governor raised five hundred and forty\\r\\nvolunteers, and placed them under the command of Franklin, with the\\r\\ntitle of General. He was to lead them, as rapidly as possible, to\\r\\nNorthampton county, for the protection of these people. His son,\\r\\nWilliam, was his aid-de-camp. He proved an efficient and valiant\\r\\nsoldier.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the middle of December when this heroic little band commenced\\r\\nits march. Snow whitened the hills. Wintry gales swept the bleak\\r\\nplains, and moaned through the forests. The roads were almost\\r\\nimpassable. Fierce storms often entirely arrested their march. The\\r\\nwilderness was very thinly inhabited. It required the toil of a month,\\r\\nfor Franklin to force his way through these many obstructions to the\\r\\nbase of his operations, though it was distant not more than ninety\\r\\nmiles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe troops moved very cautiously to guard against ambush. The\\r\\nphilosopher, Franklin, though he had never received a military\\r\\neducation, and was quite inexperienced in military affairs, was the\\r\\nlast man to be drawn into such a net as that in which the army of\\r\\nBraddock was destroyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin, as a philosopher, could appreciate the powerful influence of\\r\\nreligious motives upon the mind. Rev. Mr. Beatty was his chaplain,\\r\\nwhose worth of character Franklin appreciated. Before commencing their\\r\\nmarch, all the troops were assembled for a religious service. After an\\r\\nearnest exhortation to fidelity and duty, a fervent prayer was\\r\\noffered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe march was conducted with great regularity. First, scouts advanced\\r\\nin a semi-circular line, ranging the woods. Then came the advanced\\r\\nguard, at a few hundred paces behind. The centre followed, with all\\r\\nthe wagons and baggage. Then came the rear guard, with scouts on each\\r\\nflank, and spies on every hill.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon reaching Guadenhutton, an awful scene of desolation and carnage\\r\\nmet the eye. The once happy village presented now but a revolting\\r\\nexpanse of blackened ruins. The mangled bodies of the dead strewed the\\r\\nground, mutilated alike by the savages and the howling wolves.\\r\\nFranklin ordered huts immediately to be reared to protect his troops\\r\\nfrom the inclemency of the weather. No man knew better than he, how to\\r\\nmake them comfortable and cheerful with the least expense.\\r\\n\\r\\nA fort was promptly constructed, which he called Fort Allen, and which\\r\\ncould easily repel any attack the Indians might make, unless they\\r\\napproached with formidable French artillery. There were many\\r\\nindications that the Indians, in large numbers, were hovering around,\\r\\nwatching all their movements. But the sagacity of Franklin baffled\\r\\nthem. They kept concealed without any attack. The savages were very\\r\\ncautious men; they would seldom engage in a battle, unless they were\\r\\nsure of victory.\\r\\n\\r\\nA trifling incident occurred at this time, worthy of record as\\r\\nillustrative of the shrewdness of General Franklin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chaplain complained that the men were remiss in attending prayers.\\r\\nFranklin suggested that though it might not be exactly consistent with\\r\\nthe dignity of the chaplain to become himself the steward of the rum,\\r\\nstill, if he would order it to be distributed immediately after\\r\\nprayers, he would probably have all the men gathering around him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He liked the thought,\" Franklin wrote, \"under took the task, and\\r\\nwith the help of a few hands to measure out the liquor, executed\\r\\nit to satisfaction. Never were prayers more generally and more\\r\\npunctually attended. So that I think this method preferable to the\\r\\npunishment inflicted by some military laws for non-attendance on\\r\\ndivine worship.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBitter quarrels were renewed in the Assembly. The presence of Franklin\\r\\nwas indispensable to allay the strife. Governor Morris wrote\\r\\nentreating him immediately to return to Philadelphia. It so happened\\r\\nat this time, that Col. Clapham, a New England soldier of experience\\r\\nand high repute, visited the camp at Guadenhutton. Franklin placed him\\r\\nin command, and warmly commending him to the confidence of the troops,\\r\\nhurried home. He reached Philadelphia on the 10th of February, 1756,\\r\\nafter two months\\' service in the field. Universal applause greeted\\r\\nhim. Several military companies, in Philadelphia, united in a regiment\\r\\nof about twelve hundred men. Franklin was promptly elected their\\r\\ncolonel, which office he accepted.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn tracing the disasters of war, it is interesting to observe how many\\r\\nof those disasters are owing to unpardonable folly. Some months after\\r\\nFranklin\\'s departure, on a cold, bleak day in November, a large part\\r\\nof the garrison, unmindful of danger, were skating, like school-boys\\r\\non the Lehigh river. The vigilant Indians saw their opportunity. Like\\r\\nhowling wolves they made a rush upon the fort, entered its open\\r\\ngates, and killed or captured all its inmates. The skaters fled into\\r\\nthe woods. They were pursued. Some were killed or captured. Some\\r\\nperished miserably of cold and starvation. Probably a few escaped. The\\r\\ntriumphant savages, having plundered the fort and the dwellings of all\\r\\ntheir contents, applied the torch, and again Guadenhutton was reduced\\r\\nto a pile of ashes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe controversy which arose between the Governor and the Assembly\\r\\nbecame acrimonious in the extreme. The principles there contended for,\\r\\ninvolved the very existence of anything like American liberty. For\\r\\nfifteen years the pen and voice of Franklin were influential in this\\r\\ncontroversy. He probably did more than any other man to prepare the\\r\\ncolonists to resist the despotism of the British court, and to\\r\\nproclaim their independence.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 5th of January, 1681, King Charles the Second had conferred\\r\\nupon William Penn twenty-six million acres of the \"best land in the\\r\\nuniverse.\" This land was in the New World, and received the name of\\r\\nPennsylvania. In return for this grant, Penn agreed to pay annually,\\r\\nat Windsor Castle, two beaver skins, and one-fifth of the gold and\\r\\nsilver which the province might yield. He also promised to govern the\\r\\nprovince in conformity with the laws of England.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe could treat with the savages, appoint ordinary magistrates, and\\r\\npardon petty crimes. But he could lay no tax, and impose no law\\r\\nwithout consent of the freemen of the province, represented in the\\r\\nAssembly.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf this whole wide realm, Penn was the absolute proprietor. He refused\\r\\nto sell a single acre, absolutely, but in all the sales reserved for\\r\\nhimself what may be called a ground-rent. Immense tracts were sold at\\r\\nforty shillings, about ten dollars, for one hundred acres, reserving a\\r\\nrent of one shilling for each hundred acres. He also reserved,\\r\\nentirely to himself, various portions of the territory which promised\\r\\nto become the site of important cities and villages. All these rights\\r\\ndescended to the heirs of William Penn.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeventy-four years passed away, when the estate thus founded, was\\r\\nestimated to be worth ten millions sterling, and popular belief\\r\\naffirmed that it produced a revenue of one hundred thousand pounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nPenn, when he died, bequeathed the province to his three sons, John,\\r\\nThomas, and Richard. To John he gave a double part, or one-half of\\r\\nPennsylvania. John died and left his half to Thomas, who thus became\\r\\nproprietor of three-fourths of the province, while Richard held\\r\\none-fourth. Thus there were but two proprietors, Thomas and Richard\\r\\nPenn. They were both weak men; resided in England, were thoroughly\\r\\nimbued with Tory principles, and, in the consciousness of their vast\\r\\nestates, assumed to be lords and princes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey ruled their province by a deputy-governor. His position was\\r\\nindeed no sinecure. The two proprietaries, who appointed him, could at\\r\\nany time deprive him of office. The Assembly could refuse to vote his\\r\\nsalary, and if he displeased the king of England, he might lose, not\\r\\nonly his office, but his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe controversy which had arisen, in consequence of these involvements\\r\\nbetween the proprietaries and the people, engrossed universal\\r\\nattention. During the four years between 1754 and 1758, the ravaged\\r\\ncolony of Pennsylvania had raised the sum of two hundred and eighteen\\r\\nthousand pounds sterling, (over a million of dollars,) for defending\\r\\nits borders. And still the two lordly proprietaries demanded that\\r\\ntheir vast possessions should be entirely exempt from taxation.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo an earnest remonstrance of the Assembly, they returned an insulting\\r\\nanswer, in which they said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are no more bound to pay taxes than any other chief governor of\\r\\nthe King\\'s colonies. Your agitation of this matter is a new trick to\\r\\nsecure your re-election. We advise you to show us the respect due to\\r\\nthe rank which the crown has been pleased to bestow upon us. The\\r\\npeople of Pennsylvania, in ordinary times, are so lightly taxed, that\\r\\nthey hardly know that they are taxed. What fools you are to be\\r\\nagitating this dangerous topic of American taxation. It is beneath the\\r\\ndignity of the Assembly to make trouble about such small sums of\\r\\nmoney. We do not deny that you have been at some expense in pacifying\\r\\nthe Indians, but that is no affair of ours. We already give the\\r\\nprovince a larger sum per annum, than our share of the taxes would\\r\\namount to. One of us, for example, sent over four hundred pounds\\'\\r\\nworth of cannon, for the defence of our city of Philadelphia.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was their answer. It was conveyed in sixteen sentences which were\\r\\nnumbered and which were very similar to the ones we have given. The\\r\\ncommunication excited great displeasure. It was considered alike false\\r\\nand insolent. Even the tranquil mind of Franklin was fired with\\r\\nindignation. He replied to the document with a power of eloquence and\\r\\nlogic which carried the convictions of nearly all the colonists.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IX.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Franklin\\'s Mission to England._\\r\\n\\r\\n     New marks of respect--Lord Loudoun--Gov. Denny and\\r\\n     Franklin--Visit the Indians--Franklin commissioner to\\r\\n     England--His constant good nature--Loudoun\\'s delays--Wise\\r\\n     action of an English captain--The voyagers land at\\r\\n     Falmouth--Journey to London--Franklin\\'s style of living in\\r\\n     London--His electrical experiments--He teaches the Cambridge\\r\\n     professor--Complimentary action of St. Andrews--Gov.

Some forty of\\r\\nthe officers of his regiment, well mounted, and in rich uniform,\\r\\nwithout Franklin\\'s knowledge, came to his door, to escort him out of\\r\\nthe village. Franklin says,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I had not previously been made acquainted with their\\r\\n     project, or I should have prevented it, being naturally\\r\\n     averse to the assuming of state on any occasion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proprietaries in London heard an account of this affair. They were\\r\\nvery much displeased, saying they had never been thus honored, and\\r\\nthat princes of the blood alone were entitled to such distinction. The\\r\\nwar was still raging. Large bodies of troops were crossing the ocean\\r\\nto be united with the colonial forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Loudoun was appointed by the court commander-in-chief for\\r\\nAmerica. He was an exceedingly weak and inefficient man; scarcely a\\r\\nsoldier in the ranks could be found more incompetent for the\\r\\nsituation. Governor Morris, of Pennsylvania, worn out with his\\r\\nunavailing conflicts with the Assembly, was withdrawn, and the\\r\\nproprietaries sent out Captain William Denny as their obsequious\\r\\nservant in his stead. The Philadelphians, hoping to conciliate him,\\r\\nreceived him cordially, and with a public entertainment. William\\r\\nFranklin wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Change of devils, according to the Scotch proverb, is\\r\\n     blithesome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the close of the feast, when most of the party were making\\r\\nthemselves merry over their wine, Governor Denny took Franklin aside\\r\\ninto an adjoining room, and endeavored, by the most abounding\\r\\nflattery, and by the bribe of rich promises, to induce him to espouse\\r\\nthe cause of the proprietaries. But he soon learned that Franklin\\r\\ncould not be influenced by any of his bribes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was but a brief lull in the storm. Governor Denny had no power\\r\\nof his own. He could only obey the peremptory instructions he had\\r\\nreceived. These instructions were irreconcilably hostile to the\\r\\nresolves of the Assembly. Franklin was the all-powerful leader of the\\r\\npopular party. There was something in his imperturbable good nature\\r\\nwhich it is difficult to explain. No scenes of woe seemed to depress\\r\\nhis cheerful spirits. No atrocities of oppression could excite his\\r\\nindignation. He could thrust his keen dagger points into the vitals of\\r\\nhis antagonist, with a smile upon his face and jokes upon his lips\\r\\nwhich would convulse both friend and foe with laughter. He was the\\r\\nmost unrelenting antagonist of Governor Denny in the Assembly, and yet\\r\\nhe was the only man who remained on good terms with the governor,\\r\\nvisiting him, and dining with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernor Denny was a gentleman, and well educated, and few men could\\r\\nappear to better advantage in the saloons of fashion. But he was\\r\\ntrammeled beyond all independent action, by the instructions he had\\r\\nreceived from the proprietaries. He was right in heart, was in\\r\\nsympathy with Franklin, and with reluctance endeavored to enforce the\\r\\narbitrary measures with which he was entrusted.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin was one of the most companionable of men. His wonderful\\r\\npowers of conversation, his sweetness of temper, and his entire\\r\\nignoring of all aristocratic assumption, made him one of the most\\r\\nfascinating of guests in every circle. He charmed alike the rich and\\r\\nthe poor, the learned and the ignorant.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November, 1756, he accompanied Governor Denny to the frontier to\\r\\nconfer with the chiefs of several Indian tribes. The savages, to say\\r\\nthe least, were as punctilious in the observance of the laws of honor,\\r\\nin securing the safety of the ambassadors on such an occasion, as were\\r\\nthe English.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe governor and the philosopher rode side by side on horseback,\\r\\naccompanied by only a few body servants. The governor, familiar with\\r\\nthe clubs and the wits of England, entertained Franklin, in the\\r\\nhighest degree, with the literary gossip of London, and probably\\r\\nexcited in his mind an intense desire to visit those scenes, which he\\r\\nhimself was so calculated to enjoy and to embellish. On the journey\\r\\nhe wrote the following comic letter to his wife. He had been\\r\\ndisappointed in not receiving a line from her by a certain messenger.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I had a good mind not to write to you by this opportunity,\\r\\n     but I never can be ill-natured enough even when there is\\r\\n     most occasion. I think I won\\'t tell you that we are well,\\r\\n     and that we expect to return about the middle of the week,\\r\\n     nor will I send you a word of news; that\\'s poz. My duty to\\r\\n     mother, love to the children, and to Miss Betsy and Gracie.\\r\\n     I am your _loving_ husband.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"P. S. I have _scratched out the loving words_, being writ\\r\\n     in haste by mistake, when I forgot I was angry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGov. Denny, unable to accomplish his purposes with the Assembly,\\r\\nresolved to make a final appeal to the king. The House promptly\\r\\ndecided to imitate his example. Its Speaker, Mr. Norris, and Benjamin\\r\\nFranklin, were appointed commissioners. The Speaker declined the\\r\\noffice, and Franklin was left as sole commissioner. He probably was\\r\\nnot at all reluctant to be introduced to the statesmen, the\\r\\nphilosophers, and the fashionable circles of the Old World. To defray\\r\\nhis expenses the Assembly voted a sum of nearly eight thousand\\r\\ndollars. He had also wealth of his own. By correspondence, he was\\r\\nquite intimately acquainted with very many of the scientific men of\\r\\nEngland and France. It was very certain that he would have the\\r\\n_entrÃ©e_ to any circle which he might wish to honor with his presence.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was at that time a very serious affair to cross the Atlantic. The\\r\\nocean swarmed with pirates, privateers, and men-of-war. On the fourth\\r\\nof April, 1757, Franklin, with his son William, set out from\\r\\nPhiladelphia. His cheerfulness of spirits did not forsake him as he\\r\\nleft a home where he had been remarkably happy for twenty-six years.\\r\\nThe family he left behind him consisted of his wife, his wife\\'s aged\\r\\nmother, his daughter Sarah, a beautiful child of twelve years, one or\\r\\ntwo nieces, and an old nurse of the family.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin had written to the governor to ascertain the precise time\\r\\nwhen the packet would sail. The reply he received from him was,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I have given out that the ship is to sail on Saturday next.\\r\\n     But I may let you know _entre nous_ that if you are there by\\r\\n     Monday morning you will be in time; but do not delay any\\r\\n     longer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin was accompanied by a number of his friends as far as Trenton,\\r\\nwhere they spent a very joyful evening together. At one of the ferries\\r\\non this road, they were delayed by obstructions so that they could not\\r\\nreach the Hudson River until noon of Monday. Franklin feared that the\\r\\nship might sail without him; but upon reaching the river he was\\r\\nrelieved by seeing the vessel still in the stream.\\r\\n\\r\\nEleven weeks passed before Lord Loudoun would issue his permission for\\r\\nthe ship to sail. Every day this most dilatory and incompetent of men\\r\\nannounced that the packet would sail to-morrow. And thus the weeks\\r\\nrolled on while Franklin was waiting, but we do not hear a single word\\r\\nof impatience or remonstrance from his lips. His philosophy taught him\\r\\nto be happy under all circumstances. With a smiling face he called\\r\\nupon Lord Loudoun and dined with him. He endeavored, but in vain, to\\r\\nobtain a settlement of his claims for supplies furnished to Braddock\\'s\\r\\narmy.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe found much in the society of New York to entertain him. And more\\r\\nthan all, and above all, he was doing everything that could be done\\r\\nfor the accomplishment of his mission. Why, then, should he worry?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"New York,\" he records, \"was growing immensely rich by money brought\\r\\ninto it from all quarters for the pay and subsistence of the troops.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin was remarkably gallant in his intercourse with ladies. He\\r\\nkept up quite a brisk correspondence with several of the most\\r\\nbrilliant ladies of the day. No man could more prettily pay a\\r\\ncompliment. To his lively and beautiful friend Miss Ray he wrote upon\\r\\nhis departure,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Present my best compliments to all that love me; I should\\r\\n     have said all that love you, but that would be giving you\\r\\n     too much trouble.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length Lord Loudoun granted permission for the packet to drop down\\r\\nto the Lower Bay, where a large fleet of ninety vessels was assembled,\\r\\nfitted out for an attack upon the French at Louisburg. Franklin and\\r\\nhis friends went on board, as it was announced that the vessel would\\r\\ncertainly sail \"to-morrow.\" For six weeks longer the packet rode there\\r\\nat anchor. Franklin and his companions had for the third time consumed\\r\\nall the provisions they had laid in store for the voyage. Still we\\r\\nhear not a murmur from our imperturbable philosopher.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length the signal for sailing was given. The whole squadron put to\\r\\nsea, and the London packet, with all the rest, was swept forward\\r\\ntoward Louisburg. After a voyage of five days, a letter was placed in\\r\\nthe hands of the captain, authorizing him to quit the fleet and steer\\r\\nfor England.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe days and nights of a long voyage came and went, when the packet at\\r\\nmidnight in a gale of wind, and enveloped in fogs, was approaching\\r\\nFalmouth. A light-house, upon some rocks, had not been visible.\\r\\nSuddenly the lifting of the fog revealed the light-house and the\\r\\ncraggy shore, over which the surf was fearfully breaking, at the\\r\\ndistance of but a few rods. A captain of the Royal Navy, who chanced\\r\\nto be near the helmsman, sprang to the helm, called upon the sailors\\r\\ninstantly to wear ship, and thus, at the risk of snapping every mast,\\r\\nsaved the vessel and the crew from otherwise immediate and certain\\r\\ndestruction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was not, at that time, a single light-house on the North\\r\\nAmerican coast. The event impressed the mind of Franklin deeply, and\\r\\nhe resolved that upon his return, light-houses should be constructed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout nine o\\'clock the next morning the fog was slowly dispersed, and\\r\\nFalmouth, with its extended tower, its battlemented castles, and the\\r\\nforests of masts, was opened before the weary voyagers. It was Sunday\\r\\nmorning and the bells were ringing for church. The vessel glided into\\r\\nthe harbor, and joyfully the passengers landed. Franklin writes,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The bell ringing for church, we went thither immediately,\\r\\n     and with hearts full of gratitude returned sincere thanks to\\r\\n     God far the mercies we had received.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe know not whether this devout act was suggested by Franklin, or\\r\\nwhether he courteously fell in with the arrangement proposed, perhaps,\\r\\nby some religious companion. It is, however, certain that the sentence\\r\\nwhich next followed, in his letter, came gushing from his own mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Were I a Roman Catholic, perhaps I should, on this\\r\\n     occasion, vow to build a chapel to some saint. But as I am\\r\\n     not, if I were to vow at all it should be to build a\\r\\n     _light-house_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt required a journey of two hundred and fifty miles to reach London.\\r\\nFranklin and his son _posted_ to London, which was the most rapid mode\\r\\nof traveling in those days. They seem to have enjoyed the journey in\\r\\nthe highest degree, through blooming, beautiful, highly cultivated\\r\\nEngland. Almost every thing in the charming landscape, appeared\\r\\ndifferent from the rude settlements which were springing up amid the\\r\\nprimeval forests of the New World.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey visited the Cathedral at Salisbury, Stonehenge, Wilton Hall, the\\r\\npalatial mansion of the Earl of Pembroke. England was in her loveliest\\r\\nattire. Perhaps there could not then be found, upon this globe, a more\\r\\nlovely drive, than that through luxuriant Devonshire, and over the\\r\\nHampshire Downs.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeter Collinson, a gentleman of great wealth, first received the\\r\\ntravelers to his own hospitable mansion. Here Franklin was the object\\r\\nof marked attentions from the most distinguished scientists of\\r\\nEngland. Other gentlemen of high distinction honored themselves by\\r\\nhonoring him. Franklin visited the old printing house, where he had\\r\\nworked forty years before, and treated the workmen with that beer,\\r\\nwhich he had formerly so efficiently denounced in that same place.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon he took lodgings with a very agreeable landlady, Mrs. Stevenson,\\r\\nNo. 7, Craven street, Strand. He adopted, not an ostentatious, but a\\r\\nvery genteel style of living. Both he and his son had brought with\\r\\nthem each a body servant from America. He set up a modest carriage,\\r\\nthat he might worthily present himself at the doors of cabinet\\r\\nministers and members of parliament.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Proprietaries received him very coldly, almost insolently. They\\r\\nwere haughty, reserved and totally uninfluenced by his arguments. He\\r\\npresented to them a brief memorandum, which very lucidly explained the\\r\\nviews of the Assembly. It was as follows,\\r\\n\\r\\n     1. \"The Royal Charter gives the Assembly the power to make\\r\\n     laws; the proprietary instructions deprive it of that power.\\r\\n     2. The Royal Charter confers on the Assembly the right to\\r\\n     grant or withhold supplies; the instructions neutralize that\\r\\n     right. 3. The exemption of the proprietary estate from\\r\\n     taxation is unjust. 4. The proprietaries are besought to\\r\\n     consider these grievances seriously and redress them, that\\r\\n     harmony may be restored.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Penn brothers denounced this brief document, as vague, and\\r\\ndisrespectful. It was evident that Franklin had nothing to hope from\\r\\nthem. He therefore directed all his energies to win to his side the\\r\\nLords of Trade, and the members of the King\\'s Council, to whom the\\r\\nfinal decision must be referred. Twelve months elapsed, during which\\r\\nnothing was accomplished. But we hear not a murmur from his lips. He\\r\\nwas not only contented but jovial. For two whole years he remained in\\r\\nEngland, apparently accomplishing nothing. These hours of leisure he\\r\\ndevoted to the enjoyment of fashionable, intellectual and scientific\\r\\nsociety. No man could be a more welcome guest, in such elevated\\r\\ncircles, for no man could enjoy more richly the charms of such\\r\\nsociety, or could contribute more liberally to its fascination.\\r\\nElectricity was still a very popular branch of natural science. The\\r\\nbrilliant experiments Franklin performed, lured many to his\\r\\napartments. His machine was the largest which had been made, and would\\r\\nemit a spark nine inches in length. He had invented, or greatly\\r\\nimproved, a new musical machine of glass goblets, called the Armonica.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was listened to with much admiration, as it gave forth the sweetest\\r\\ntones. He played upon this instrument with great effect.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe theatre was to Franklin an inexhaustible source of enjoyment.\\r\\nGarrick was then in the meridian of his fame. He loved a good dinner,\\r\\nand could, without inconvenience, empty the second bottle of claret.\\r\\nHe wrote to a friend,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I find that I love company, chat, a laugh, a glass, and\\r\\n     even a song as well as ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt one time he took quite an extensive tour through England, visiting\\r\\nthe University at Cambridge. He was received with the most flattering\\r\\nattentions from the chancellor and others of the prominent members of\\r\\nthe faculty. Indeed every summer, during his stay in England, Franklin\\r\\nand his son spent a few weeks visiting the most attractive scenes of\\r\\nthe beautiful island. Wherever he went, he left an impression behind\\r\\nhim, which greatly increased his reputation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Cambridge he visited the chemical laboratory, with the\\r\\ndistinguished Professor of Chemistry, Dr. Hadley. Franklin suggested\\r\\nthat temperature could be astonishingly reduced by evaporation. It was\\r\\nentirely a new idea to the Professor. They both with others repaired\\r\\nto Franklin\\'s room. He had ether there, and a thermometer. To the\\r\\nastonishment of the Professor of Chemistry in Cambridge University,\\r\\nthe printer from Philadelphia showed him that by dipping the ball into\\r\\nthe ether, and then blowing upon it with bellows to increase the\\r\\nevaporation, the mercury rapidly sunk twenty-five degrees below the\\r\\nfreezing point. Ice was formed a quarter of an inch thick, all around\\r\\nthe ball. Thus, surrounded by the professors of one of the most\\r\\ndistinguished universities of Europe, Benjamin Franklin was the\\r\\nteacher of the teachers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe father and the son visited the villages where their ancestors had\\r\\nlived. They sought out poor relations, and examined the tombstones. In\\r\\nthe spring of 1769, they spent six weeks in Scotland. The University\\r\\nof St. Andrews conferred upon Franklin the honorary title of doctor,\\r\\nby which he has since been generally known. Other universities\\r\\nreceived him with great distinction. The corporation of Edinburgh\\r\\nvoted him the freedom of the city. All the saloons of fashion were not\\r\\nonly open to receive him, but his presence, at every brilliant\\r\\nentertainment, was eagerly sought. The most distinguished men of\\r\\nletters crowded around him. Hume, Robertson and Lord Kames became his\\r\\nintimate friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese were honors sufficient to turn the head of almost any man. But\\r\\nFranklin, who allowed no adversity to annoy him, could not be unduly\\r\\nelated by any prosperity or flattery.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"On the whole,\" writes Franklin, \"I must say, that the time\\r\\n     we spent there (Scotland) was six weeks of the _densest_\\r\\n     happiness I have met with in any part of my life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStill it is evident that occasionally he felt some slight yearnings\\r\\nfor the joys of that home, over which his highly esteemed wife\\r\\npresided with such economy and skill. He wrote to her,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The regard and friendship I meet with from persons of worth,\\r\\n     and the conversation of ingenuous men give me no small\\r\\n     pleasure. But at this time of life, domestic comforts afford\\r\\n     the most solid satisfaction;[20] and my uneasiness at being\\r\\n     absent from my family and longing desire to be with them,\\r\\n     make me often sigh, in the midst of cheerful company.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 20: Franklin was then 53 years of age.]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn English gentleman, Mr. Strahan, wrote to Mrs. Franklin, urging her\\r\\nto come over to England and join her husband. In this letter he said,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I never saw a man who was, in every respect, so perfectly\\r\\n     agreeable to me. Some are amiable in one view, some in\\r\\n     another; he in all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThree years thus passed away. It must not be supposed that the\\r\\npatriotic and faithful Franklin lost any opportunity whatever, to urge\\r\\nthe all important cause with which he was entrusted. His philosophy\\r\\ntaught him that when he absolutely could not do any thing but _wait_,\\r\\nit was best to wait in the most agreeable and profitable manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was one of his strong desires, which he was compelled to abandon,\\r\\nto convert the proprietary province of Pennsylvania into a royal\\r\\nprovince. After Franklin left Philadelphia, the strife between\\r\\nthe Assembly, and Governor Denny, as the representative of the\\r\\nproprietaries, became more violent than ever. The governor, worn out\\r\\nby the ceaseless struggle, yielded in some points. This offended the\\r\\nproprietaries. Indignantly they dismissed him and appointed, in his\\r\\nplace, Mr. James Hamilton, a more obsequious servant.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the royal charter it was provided that all laws, passed by the\\r\\nAssembly and signed by the governor, should be sent to the king, for\\r\\nhis approval. One of the bills which the governor, compelled as it\\r\\nwere by the peril of public affairs, had signed, allowed the Assembly\\r\\nto raise a sum of about five hundred thousand dollars, to be raised by\\r\\na _tax on all estates_. This was a dangerous precedent. The\\r\\naristocratic court of England repealed it, as an encroachment upon the\\r\\nrights of the privileged classes. It was a severe blow to the\\r\\nAssembly. The speaker wrote to Franklin:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"We are among rocks and sands, in a stormy season. It depends\\r\\n     upon you to do every thing in your power in the present\\r\\n     crisis. It is too late for us to give you any assistance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Franklin received the crushing report against the Assembly he\\r\\nwas just setting off for a pleasant June excursion in Ireland.\\r\\nImmediately he unpacked his saddle-bags, and consecrated all his\\r\\nenergies to avert the impending evils. He enlisted the sympathies of\\r\\nLord Mansfield, and accomplished the astonishing feat in diplomacy, of\\r\\ninducing the British Lords of Commission to reverse their decision,\\r\\nand to vote that the act of the Assembly should stand unrepealed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis business detained Franklin in London all summer. In the autumn he\\r\\ntook a tour into the west of England and Wales. The gales of winter\\r\\nwere now sweeping the Atlantic. No man in his senses would expose\\r\\nhimself to a winter passage across the ocean, unless it was absolutely\\r\\nnecessary. Indeed it would appear that Franklin was so happy in\\r\\nEngland, that he was not very impatient to see his home again. Though\\r\\nhe had been absent three years from his wife and child, still two\\r\\nyears more elapsed before he embarked for his native land.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 25th of October George II. died. His grandson, a stupid,\\r\\nstubborn fanatically conscientious young man ascended the throne, with\\r\\nthe title of George III. It would be difficult to compute the\\r\\nmultitudes in Europe, Asia and America, whom his arrogance and\\r\\nambition caused to perish on the battle field. During these two years\\r\\nthere was nothing of very special moment which occurred in the life of\\r\\nFranklin. Able as he was as a statesman, science was the favorite\\r\\nobject of his pursuit. He wrote several very strong pamphlets upon the\\r\\npolitical agitations of those tumultuous days, when all nations seem\\r\\nto have been roused to cutting each other\\'s throats. He continued to\\r\\noccupy a prominent position wherever he was, and devoted much time in\\r\\ncollecting his thoughts upon a treatise to be designated \"The Art of\\r\\nVirtue.\" The treatise, however, was never written.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis influential and wealthy friend, Mr. Strahan, was anxious to unite\\r\\ntheir two families by the marriage of his worthy and prosperous son to\\r\\nMr. Franklin\\'s beautiful daughter, Sarah. But the plan failed.\\r\\nFranklin also made an effort to marry his only son William, who, it\\r\\nwill be remembered, was not born in wedlock, to a very lovely English\\r\\nlady, Miss Stephenson. But this young man, who, renouncing revealed\\r\\nreligion, was a law unto himself, had already become a father without\\r\\nbeing a husband. Miss Stephenson had probably learned this fact and,\\r\\ngreatly to the disappointment of Franklin, declined the alliance. The\\r\\nunhappy boy, the dishonored son of a dishonored father, was born about\\r\\nthe year 1760. Nothing is known of what became of the discarded\\r\\nmother. He received the name of William Temple Franklin.\\r\\n\\r\\nBenjamin Franklin, as in duty bound, recognized him as his grandson,\\r\\nand received him warmly to his house and his heart. The reader will\\r\\nhereafter become better acquainted with the character and career of\\r\\nthis young man. In the spring of 1762, Franklin commenced preparations\\r\\nfor his return home. He did not reach Philadelphia until late in the\\r\\nautumn. Upon his departure from England, the University of Oxford\\r\\nconferred upon him the distinction of an honorary degree.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam Franklin, though devoid of moral principle, was a man of\\r\\nhighly respectable abilities, of pleasing manners, and was an\\r\\nentertaining companion. Lord Bute, who was in power, was the warm\\r\\nfriend of Dr. Franklin. He therefore caused his son William to be\\r\\nappointed governor of New Jersey. It is positively asserted that\\r\\nFranklin did not solicit the favor. Indeed it was not a very desirable\\r\\noffice. Its emoluments amounted to but about three thousand dollars a\\r\\nyear. The governorship of the colonies was generally conferred upon\\r\\nthe needy sons of the British aristocracy. So many of them had\\r\\ndeveloped characters weak and unworthy, that they were not regarded\\r\\nwith much esteem.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam Franklin was married on the 2d of September, 1762, to Miss\\r\\nElizabeth Downes. The announcement of the marriage in London, and of\\r\\nhis appointment to the governorship of New Jersey, created some\\r\\nsensation. Mr. John Penn, son of one of the proprietaries, and who was\\r\\nsoon to become governor of Pennsylvania, affected great indignation in\\r\\nview of the fact that William Franklin was to be a brother governor.\\r\\nHe wrote to Lord Stirling,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"It is no less amazing than true, that Mr. William Franklin,\\r\\n     son of Benjamin Franklin of Philadelphia, is appointed to be\\r\\n     governor of the province of New Jersey. I make no doubt that\\r\\n     the people of New Jersey will make some remonstrances at\\r\\n     this indignity put upon them. You are full as well\\r\\n     acquainted with the character and principles of this person\\r\\n     as myself, and are as able to judge of the impropriety of\\r\\n     such an appointment. What a dishonor and a disgrace it must\\r\\n     be to a country to have such a man at the head of it, and to\\r\\n     sit down contented. I should hope that some effort will be\\r\\n     made before our Jersey friends would put up with such an\\r\\n     insult. If any _gentleman_ had been appointed, it would have\\r\\n     been a different case. But I cannot look upon the person in\\r\\n     question in that light by any means. I may perhaps be too\\r\\n     strong in my expressions, but I am so extremely astonished\\r\\n     and enraged at it, that I am hardly able to contain myself\\r\\n     at the thought of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin sailed from Portsmouth the latter part of August. Quite a\\r\\nfleet of American merchantmen sailed together. The weather during a\\r\\nvoyage of nine weeks, was most of the time delightful. Often the\\r\\nvessels glided along so gently over a waveless sea, that the\\r\\npassengers could visit, and exchange invitations for dinner parties.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the first of November, Franklin reached his home. He had been\\r\\nabsent nearly six years. All were well. His daughter, whom he had left\\r\\na child of twelve, was now a remarkably beautiful and accomplished\\r\\nmaiden of eighteen. Franklin was received not only with affection, but\\r\\nwith enthusiasm. The Assembly voted him fifteen thousand dollars for\\r\\nhis services in England.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis son William, with his bride, did not arrive until the next\\r\\nFebruary. Franklin accompanied him to New Jersey. The people there\\r\\ngave the governor a very kind greeting. He took up his residence in\\r\\nBurlington, within fifteen miles of the home of his father.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin had attained the age of fifty-seven. He was in perfect\\r\\nhealth, had an ample fortune, and excelled most men in his dignified\\r\\nbearing and his attractive features. Probably there never was a more\\r\\nhappy man. He had leisure to devote himself to his beloved sciences.\\r\\nIt was his dream, his castle in the air, to withdraw from political\\r\\nlife, and devote the remainder of his days to philosophical research.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the year 1763 terminated the seven years\\' war. There was peace in\\r\\nEurope, peace on the ocean, but not peace along the blood crimsoned\\r\\nfrontiers of the wilderness of America. England and France had been\\r\\nhurling savage warriors by tens of thousands against each other, and\\r\\nagainst the helpless emigrants in their defenceless villages and their\\r\\nlonely cabins. The belligerent powers of Europe, in their ambitious\\r\\nstruggles, cared very little for the savages of North America. Like\\r\\nthe hungry wolf they had lapped blood. Plunder had become as\\r\\nattractive to them as to the privateersman and the pirate. During the\\r\\nsummer of 1763, the western regions of Pennsylvania were fearfully\\r\\nravaged by these fierce bands. Thousands of settlers were driven from\\r\\ntheir homes, their buildings laid in ashes, and their farms utterly\\r\\ndesolated.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn all the churches contributions were raised, in behalf of the\\r\\nvictims of this insane and utterly needless war. Christ Church alone\\r\\nraised between three and four thousand dollars; and sent a missionary\\r\\nto expend the sum among these starving, woe-stricken families. The\\r\\nmissionary reported seven hundred and fifty farms in Pennsylvania\\r\\nalone, utterly abandoned. Two hundred and fifty women and children,\\r\\ndestitute and despairing, had fled to Fort Pitt for protection.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the midst of these awful scenes, Governor Hamilton resigned, and\\r\\nthe weak, haughty John Penn arriving, took his place. The Assembly, as\\r\\nusual, gave him a courteous reception, wishing, if possible, to avert\\r\\na quarrel. There were many fanatics in those days. Some of these\\r\\nassumed that God was displeased, because the heathen Indians had not\\r\\nbeen entirely exterminated. The savages had perpetrated such horrors,\\r\\nthat by them no distinction was made between those friendly to the\\r\\nEnglish, and those hostile. The very name of Indian was loathed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the vicinity of Lancaster, there was the feeble remnant of a once\\r\\npowerful tribe. The philanthropy of William Penn had won them to love\\r\\nthe English. No one of them had ever been known to lift his hand\\r\\nagainst a white man. There were but twenty remaining, seven men, five\\r\\nwomen and eight children. They were an industrious, peaceful, harmless\\r\\npeople, having adopted English names, English customs and the\\r\\nChristian religion.\\r\\n\\r\\nA vagabond party of Scotch-Irish, from Paxton, set out, in the morning\\r\\nof the 14th of December, for their destruction. They were well mounted\\r\\nand well armed. It so happened that there were but six Indians at\\r\\nhome. They made no defence. Parents and children knelt, as in prayer,\\r\\nand silently received the death blow. Every head was cleft by the\\r\\nhatchet. These poor creatures were very affectionate, and had greatly\\r\\nendeared themselves to their neighbors. This deed of infamous\\r\\nassassination roused the indignation of many of the most worthy people\\r\\nin the province. But there were thousands of the baser sort, who\\r\\ndeemed it no crime to kill an Indian, any more than a wolf or a bear.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin wrote, to the people of Pennsylvania, a noble letter of\\r\\nindignant remonstrance, denouncing the deed as atrocious murder.\\r\\nVividly he pictured the scene of the assassination, and gave the\\r\\nnames, ages and characters of the victims. A hundred and forty\\r\\nMoravian Indians, the firm and unsuspected friends of the English,\\r\\nterrified by this massacre, fled to Philadelphia for protection. The\\r\\nletter of Franklin had excited much sympathy in their behalf. The\\r\\npeople rallied for their protection. The Paxton murderers, several\\r\\nhundred in number, pursued the fugitives, avowing their determination\\r\\nto put every one to death. The imbecile governor was at his wits\\' end.\\r\\nFranklin was summoned.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe, at once, proclaimed his house headquarters; rallied a regiment of\\r\\na thousand men, and made efficient arrangements to give the murderers\\r\\na warm reception. The Paxton band reached Germantown. Franklin,\\r\\nanxious to avoid bloodshed, rode out with three aids, to confer with\\r\\nthe leaders. He writes,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The fighting face we had put on, and the reasonings we used\\r\\n     with the insurgents, having turned them back, and restored\\r\\n     quiet to the city, I became a less man than ever; for I had,\\r\\n     by this transaction, made myself many enemies among the\\r\\n     populace.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER X.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Franklin\\'s Second Mission to England._\\r\\n\\r\\n     Fiendish conduct of John Penn--Petition to the crown--Debt\\r\\n     of England--Two causes of conflict--Franklin sent to\\r\\n     England--His embarkation--Wise counsel to his daughter--The\\r\\n     stamp act--American resolves--Edmund Burke--Examination of\\r\\n     Franklin--Words of Lord Chatham--Dangers to English\\r\\n     operatives--Repeal of the stamp act--Joy in America--Ross\\r\\n     Mackay--New taxes levied--Character of George\\r\\n     III--Accumulation of honors to Franklin--Warlike\\r\\n     preparations--Human conscientiousness--Unpopularity of\\r\\n     William Franklin--Marriage of Sarah Franklin--Franklin\\'s\\r\\n     varied investigations--Efforts to civilize the Sandwich\\r\\n     Islands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is scarcely too severe to say that Governor John Penn was both\\r\\nknave and fool. To ingratiate himself with the vile Paxton men and\\r\\ntheir partisans, he issued a proclamation, offering for every captive\\r\\nmale Indian, of any hostile tribe, one hundred and fifty dollars, for\\r\\nevery female, one hundred and thirty-eight dollars. For the scalp of a\\r\\nmale, the bounty was one hundred and thirty-eight dollars; for the\\r\\nscalp of a female fifty dollars. Of course it would be impossible,\\r\\nwhen the scalps were brought in to decide whether they were stripped\\r\\nfrom friendly or hostile heads.\\r\\n\\r\\nCuriously two political parties were thus organized. The governor,\\r\\nintensely inimical to Franklin, led all the loose fellows who approved\\r\\nof the massacre of the friendly Indians. Franklin was supported by the\\r\\nhumane portion of the community, who regarded that massacre with\\r\\nhorror.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was much bitterness engendered. Franklin was assailed and\\r\\ncalumniated as one of the worst of men. He, as usual, wrote a\\r\\npamphlet, which was read far and wide. Earnestly he urged that the\\r\\ncrown, as it had a right to do, should, by purchase, take possession\\r\\nof the province and convert its government into that of a royal\\r\\ncolony. It should be remembered that this was several years before the\\r\\ntroubles of the revolution arose. The people were in heart true\\r\\nEnglishmen. Fond of their nationality, sincere patriotism glowed in\\r\\nall bosoms. They ever spoke of England as \"home.\" When the Assembly\\r\\nmet again three thousand citizens, influenced mainly by Franklin\\'s\\r\\npamphlet, sent in a petition that the province might revert to the\\r\\ncrown. The Penns succeeded in presenting a counter petition signed by\\r\\nthree hundred.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British cabinet, in its insatiable thirst for universal conquest,\\r\\nor impelled by necessity to repel the encroachments of other nations,\\r\\nequally wicked and equally grasping, had been by fleet and army,\\r\\nfighting all over the world. After spending every dollar which the\\r\\nmost cruel taxation could extort from the laboring and impoverished\\r\\nmasses, the government had incurred the enormous debt of seventy-three\\r\\nmillions sterling. This amounted to over three hundred and sixty-five\\r\\nmillions of our money.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government decided to tax the Americans to help pay the interest\\r\\non this vast sum. But the colonies were already taxed almost beyond\\r\\nendurance, to carry on the terrible war against the French and\\r\\nIndians. This war was not one of their own choosing. It had been\\r\\nforced upon them by the British Cabinet, in its resolve to drive the\\r\\nFrench off the continent of North America. The Americans were allowed\\r\\nno representation in Parliament. They were to be taxed according to\\r\\nthe caprice of the government. Franklin, with patriotic foresight,\\r\\nvehemently, and with resistless force of logic, resisted the outrage.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will be perceived that there were now two quite distinct sources of\\r\\ncontroversy. First came the conflict with the proprietaries, and then\\r\\nrose the still more important strife with the cabinet of Great\\r\\nBritain, to repel the principle of taxation without representation.\\r\\nThis principle once admitted, the crown could tax the Americans to any\\r\\namount whatever it pleased. Many unreflecting people could not\\r\\nappreciate these disastrous results.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus all the partisans of the Penns, and all the office holders of the\\r\\ncrown and their friends, and there were many such, became not only\\r\\nopposed to Franklin, but implacable in their hostility. The majority\\r\\nof the Assembly was with him. He was chosen Speaker, and then was\\r\\nelected to go again to England, to carry with him to the British\\r\\nCourt the remonstrances of the people against \"taxation without\\r\\nrepresentation,\" and their earnest petition to be delivered from the\\r\\ntyranny of the Penns. More unwelcome messages to the British Court and\\r\\naristocracy, he could not well convey. It was certain that the Penns\\r\\nand their powerful coadjutors, would set many influences in array\\r\\nagainst him. Mr. Dickinson, in the Assembly, remonstrating against\\r\\nthis appointment, declared that there was no man in Pennsylvania who\\r\\nwas more the object of popular dislike than Benjamin Franklin.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut two years had elapsed since Franklin\\'s return to America, after an\\r\\nabsence from his home of six years. He still remembered fondly the\\r\\n\"dense happiness\" which he had enjoyed in the brilliant circles\\r\\nabroad. This, added to an intensity of patriotism, which rendered him\\r\\nsecond to none but Washington, among the heroes of the Revolution,\\r\\ninduced him promptly to accept the all important mission. He allowed\\r\\nbut twelve days to prepare for his embarkation. The treasury was\\r\\nempty, and money for his expenses had to be raised by a loan. A packet\\r\\nship, bound for London was riding at Chester, fifteen miles below the\\r\\ncity. Three hundred of the citizens of Philadelphia, on horseback,\\r\\nescorted Franklin to the ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seldom attended church, though he always encouraged his wife and\\r\\ndaughter to do so. It was genteel; it was politic. A family could\\r\\nscarcely command the respect of the community, which, in the midst of\\r\\na religious people, should be living without any apparent object of\\r\\nworship. The preacher of Christ Church, which the family attended, was\\r\\na partisan of the Penns. Sometimes he \"meddled with politics.\"\\r\\nFranklin in his parting letter, from on shipboard, wrote to his\\r\\ndaughter:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Go constantly to church, whoever preaches. The active\\r\\n     devotion in the common prayer-book, is your principal\\r\\n     business there, and if properly attended to, will do more\\r\\n     towards amending the heart, than sermons generally can do.\\r\\n     For they were composed by men of much greater piety and\\r\\n     wisdom, than our common composers of sermons can pretend to\\r\\n     be. Therefore I wish that you would never miss the prayer\\r\\n     days. Yet I do not mean you should despise sermons, even of\\r\\n     the preachers you dislike; for the discourse is often much\\r\\n     better than the man, as sweet and clear waters come through\\r\\n     very dirty earth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe voyage was stormy; it lasted thirty days. On the evening of the\\r\\ntenth of December, 1764, he again took up his residence in the house\\r\\nof Mrs. Stephenson and her daughter, where he was received with\\r\\ndelight. He found several other agents of the colonies in London, who\\r\\nhad also been sent to remonstrate against the despotic measures which\\r\\nthe British Cabinet threatened, of taxing the Americans at its\\r\\npleasure, without allowing them to have any voice in deciding upon the\\r\\nsums which they should pay.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrenville was prime minister. He was about to introduce the Stamp Act,\\r\\nas an initiatory measure. It imposed but a trivial tax, in itself of\\r\\nbut little importance, but was intended as an experiment, to ascertain\\r\\nwhether the Americans would submit to the principle. This fact being\\r\\nonce established, the government could then proceed to demand money at\\r\\nits pleasure. Franklin opposed the tax with all his energies. He\\r\\ndeclared it, in his own forceful language, to be the \"mother of\\r\\nmischiefs.\" With four other colonial agents, he held an interview with\\r\\nLord Grenville. The usual arguments were employed on both sides. Lord\\r\\nGrenville was courteous, but very decided. The Americans he declared\\r\\nmust help England pay the interest on her debt, and the parliament of\\r\\nGreat Britain alone could decide how large an amount of money the\\r\\nAmericans should pay. The bill was introduced to parliament, and\\r\\npassed by a large majority. The king signed it in a scrawling hand,\\r\\nwhich some think indicated the insanity he was beginning to develop.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trivial sum expected to be raised by the Stamp Act amounted to\\r\\nscarcely one hundred thousand pounds a year. It was thought that the\\r\\nAmericans would not venture upon any decisive opposition to England\\r\\nfor such a trifle. Franklin wrote to a friend:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I took every step in my power, to prevent the passing of the\\r\\n     Stamp Act. But the tide was too strong against us. The nation\\r\\n     was provoked by American claims of legislative independence;\\r\\n     and all parties joined in resolving, by this act, to settle\\r\\n     the point.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus Franklin entirely failed in arresting the passing of the Stamp\\r\\nAct. He was also equally unsuccessful in his endeavor to promote a\\r\\nchange of government, from the proprietary to the royal. And still his\\r\\nmission proved a success. By conversations, pamphlets and articles in\\r\\nthe newspapers, he raised throughout the country such an opposition\\r\\nto the measure that parliament was compelled to repeal it. The tidings\\r\\nof the passage of the Stamp Act was received in intelligent America,\\r\\nwith universal expressions of displeasure, and with resolves to oppose\\r\\nits operation in every possible way.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is remarked of a celebrated theological professor, that he once\\r\\nsaid to his pupils,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When you go to the city to preach, take your best coat; when to the\\r\\ncountry, take your best sermon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lords and gentry of England were astonished at the intelligence\\r\\ndisplayed in the opposition, by the rural population of America. They\\r\\nfancied the colonists to be an ignorant, ragged people, living in log\\r\\ncabins, scattered through the wilderness, and, in social position, two\\r\\nor three degrees below European and Irish peasantry. Great was their\\r\\nsurprise to hear from all the colonies, and from the remotest\\r\\ndistricts in each colony, the voice of intelligent and dignified\\r\\nrebuke.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Act was to go into execution on the first of November, 1765.\\r\\nBefore that time, Franklin had spread, through all the mechanical,\\r\\nmercantile and commercial classes, the conviction that they would\\r\\nsuffer ten-fold more, by the interruptions of trade which the Stamp\\r\\nAct would introduce, than government could hope to gain by the\\r\\nmeasure. He spread abroad the intelligence which came by every fresh\\r\\narrival, that the Americans were resolving, with wonderful unanimity,\\r\\nthat they would consume no more English manufactures, that they would\\r\\npurchase no more British goods, and that, as far as possible, in food,\\r\\nclothing, and household furniture, they would depend upon their own\\r\\nproductions. They had even passed resolves to eat no more lamb, that\\r\\ntheir flocks might so increase that they should have wool enough to\\r\\nmanufacture their own clothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nEngland had thus far furnished nearly all the supplies for the rapidly\\r\\nincreasing colonies, already numbering a population of between two and\\r\\nthree millions. The sudden cessation of this trade was felt in nearly\\r\\nevery warehouse of industry. No more orders came. Goods accumulated\\r\\nwithout purchasers. Violent opposition arose, and vast meetings were\\r\\nheld in the manufacturing districts, to remonstrate against the\\r\\nmeasures of the government. Edmund Burke, a host in himself, headed\\r\\nthe opposition in parliament.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurke and Franklin were intimate friends, and the renowned orator\\r\\nobtained from the renowned philosopher, many of those arguments and\\r\\ncaptivating illustrations, which, uttered on the floor of parliament,\\r\\nastonished England, and reaching our shores, electrified America. The\\r\\nstate of affairs became alarming. In some places the stamps were\\r\\ndestroyed, in others, no one could be found who would venture upon the\\r\\nobnoxious task of offering to sell them. The parliament resolved\\r\\nitself into a committee of the whole house, and spent six weeks in\\r\\nhearing testimony respecting the operation of the act in America. The\\r\\nhall was crowded with eager listeners. The industrial prosperity of\\r\\nthe nation seemed at stake. Franklin was the principal witness. His\\r\\ntestimony overshadowed all the rest. The record of it was read with\\r\\nadmiration. Seldom has a man been placed in a more embarrassing\\r\\nsituation, and never has one, under such circumstances, acquitted\\r\\nhimself more triumphantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was examined and cross-examined, before this vast and imposing\\r\\nassemblage, by the shrewdest lawyers of the crown. Every attempt was\\r\\nmade to throw him into embarrassment, to trip him in his speech. But\\r\\nnever for a moment did Franklin lose his self-possession. Never for an\\r\\ninstant, did he hesitate in his reply. In the judgment of all his\\r\\nfriends, not a mistake did he make. His mind seemed to be omnisciently\\r\\nfurnished, with all the needful statistics for as rigorous an\\r\\nexamination as any mortal was ever exposed to. Burke wrote to a\\r\\nfriend, \"that Franklin, as he stood before the bar of parliament,\\r\\npresented such an aspect of dignity and intellectual superiority, as\\r\\nto remind him of a schoolmaster questioned by school boys.\" Rev.\\r\\nGeorge Whitefield wrote,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Our worthy friend, Dr. Franklin, has gained immortal honor,\\r\\n     by his behavior at the bar of the house. The answer was\\r\\n     always found equal, if not superior to the questioner. He\\r\\n     stood unappalled, gave pleasure to his friends, and did\\r\\n     honor to his country.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter great agitation and many and stormy debates, the haughty\\r\\ngovernment was compelled to yield to the demands of the industrial\\r\\nclasses. Indeed, with those in England, who cried most loudly for the\\r\\nrepeal of the stamp act, there were comparatively few who were\\r\\ninfluenced by any sympathy for the Americans, or by any appreciation\\r\\nof the justice of their cause. The loss of the American trade was\\r\\nimpoverishing them. Selfish considerations alone,--their own personal\\r\\ninterests--moved them to action.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were individuals, in and out of Parliament, who recognized the\\r\\nrights of Englishmen, and regarding the Americans as Englishmen, and\\r\\nAmerica as a portion of the British empire, were in heart and with all\\r\\ntheir energies, in sympathy with the Americans in their struggle for\\r\\ntheir rights. When the despotism of the British court led that court\\r\\nto the infamous measure of sending fleets and armies, to compel the\\r\\nAmericans to submission, and the feeble colonists, less than three\\r\\nmillions in number, performing the boldest and most heroic deeds ever\\r\\nyet recorded in history, grasped their arms in self-defence, thus to\\r\\nwage war against the most powerful naval and military empire upon this\\r\\nglobe, Lord Chatham, with moral courage rarely surpassed, boldly\\r\\nexclaimed in the House of Lords, \"Were I an American, as I am an\\r\\nEnglishman, I would never lay down my arms, never, _never_, NEVER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn all England, there was no man more determined in his resolve to\\r\\nbring the Americans to servile obedience, than the stubborn king,\\r\\nGeorge III. The repeal gave him intense offence. The equally\\r\\nunprincipled, but more intelligent, ministers were compelled to the\\r\\nmeasure, as they saw clearly that England was menaced with civil war,\\r\\nwhich would array the industrial classes generally against the\\r\\naristocracy. In such a conflict it was far from improbable that the\\r\\naristocracy would be brought to grief. Horace Walpole wrote,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"It was the clamor of trade, of merchants, and of\\r\\n     manufacturing towns, that had borne down all opposition. A\\r\\n     general insurrection was apprehended, as the immediate\\r\\n     consequence of upholding the bill. The revolt of America,\\r\\n     and the destruction of trade, was the prospect in future.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStill the question of the repeal was carried in the House but by a\\r\\nmajority of one hundred and eight votes. Of course Franklin now\\r\\nsolicited permission to return home. The Assembly, instead of granting\\r\\nhis request, elected him agent for another year. It does not appear\\r\\nthat Franklin was disappointed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe report of his splendid and triumphant examination, before the\\r\\nCommons, and the republication of many of his pamphlets, had raised\\r\\nhim to the highest position of popularity. The Americans, throughout\\r\\nall the provinces, received tidings of the Repeal with unbounded\\r\\ndelight. Bells were rung, bon-fires blazed, cannon were fired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never heard so much noise in my life,\" wrote Sally to her \"honored\\r\\npapa.\" \"The very children seemed distracted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tory party in England developed no little malignity in their\\r\\nanger, in view of the discomfiture of their plans. The bigoted Tory,\\r\\nDr. Johnson, wrote to Bishop White of Pennsylvania, that if he had\\r\\nbeen Prime Minister, instead of repealing the act, he would have sent\\r\\na man-of-war, and laid one or more of our largest cities in ashes.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 21: Wilson\\'s Life of Bishop White, p. 89.]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king felt personally aggrieved. His denunciations of those who\\r\\nfavored the Repeal were so indecent, that some of his most influential\\r\\nfriends ventured to intimate to him that it was highly impolitic.\\r\\nIndeed, as the previous narrative has shown, many who were in entire\\r\\nsympathy with the king, and who were bitterly opposed to any\\r\\nconcession to the Americans, felt compelled to vote for the Repeal.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo propitiate the unrelenting and half-crazed monarch, with his\\r\\nobdurate court, a Declaratory Act, as it was called, was passed, which\\r\\naffirmed the _absolute supremacy_ of Parliament over the colonies.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe hear very much of the corruption of our own Congress. It is said\\r\\nthat votes are sometimes bought and sold. Sir Nathaniel Wraxall, who\\r\\nwas a member of Parliament during all this period, declares, in his\\r\\nintensely interesting and undoubtedly honest Memoir, that under\\r\\nthe ministry of Lord Bute, Ross Mackay was employed by him as\\r\\n\"corrupter-general\" whose mission it was to carry important measures\\r\\nof government by bribery. Wraxall writes that Ross Mackay said to him,\\r\\nat a dinner party given by Lord Besborough, as the illustrious guests\\r\\nwere sipping their wine,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The peace of 1763 was carried through and approved by a\\r\\n     pecuniary dispensation. Nothing else could have surmounted\\r\\n     the difficulty. I was myself the channel through which the\\r\\n     money passed. With my own hand I secured above one hundred\\r\\n     and twenty votes on that most important question to\\r\\n     ministers. Eighty thousand pounds were set apart for the\\r\\n     purpose. Forty members of the House of Commons received from\\r\\n     me a thousand pounds each. To eighty others I paid five\\r\\n     hundred pounds a-piece.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe unrelenting king was still determined that the Americans,\\r\\nunrepresented in Parliament, should still pay into his treasury\\r\\nwhatever sums of money he might exact. Calling to his aid courtiers\\r\\nmore shrewd than himself, they devised a very cunning act, to attain\\r\\nthat object in a way which would hardly be likely to excite\\r\\nopposition. They laid a tax, insignificant really in its amount, upon\\r\\npaper, paint, glass, and tea. This tax was to be collected at the\\r\\ncustom-houses in the few ports of entry in the colonies. The whole\\r\\namount thus raised would not exceed forty thousand pounds. It was\\r\\nthought that the Americans would never make opposition to so trivial a\\r\\npayment.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it established a principle that England could tax the colonies\\r\\nwithout allowing those colonies any representation in Parliament. If\\r\\nthe Court had a right thus to demand forty thousand pounds, they had\\r\\na right to demand so many millions, should it seem expedient to king\\r\\nand cabinet so to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great blunder which the court committed, was in not appreciating\\r\\nthe wide-spread intelligence of the American people. In New England\\r\\nparticularly, and throughout the colonies generally, there was\\r\\nscarcely a farmer who did not perceive the trick, and despise it. They\\r\\ndeemed it an insult to their intelligence.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstantly there arose, throughout all the provinces, the most\\r\\ndetermined opposition to the measure. It was in fact merely a renewal\\r\\nof the Stamp Act, under slightly modified forms. If they admitted the\\r\\njustice of this act, it was only declaring that they had acted with\\r\\nunpardonable folly, in opposing the tax under the previous form.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Franklin, with honest shrewdness, not with trickery or with\\r\\ncunning, but with a sincere and penetrating mind, eagerly scrutinized\\r\\nall the measures of the Court. George III. was a gentleman. He was\\r\\nirreproachable in all his domestic relations. He was, in a sense,\\r\\nconscientious; for certainly he was not disposed to do anything which\\r\\nhe thought to be wrong. Conscientious men have burned their\\r\\nfellow-Christians at the stake. It is said that George the Third was a\\r\\nChristian. He certainly was a full believer in the religion of Jesus\\r\\nChrist; and earnestly advocated the support and extension of that\\r\\nreligion. God makes great allowance for the frailties of his fallen\\r\\nchildren. It requires the wisdom of omniscience to decide how much\\r\\nwickedness there may be in the heart, consistently with piety. No man\\r\\nis perfect.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the reign of George III., terrible wars were waged throughout\\r\\nall the world, mainly incited by the British Court. Millions perished.\\r\\nThe moans of widows and orphans ascended from every hand. This wicked\\r\\nChristian king sent his navy and his army to burn down our cities and\\r\\nvillages, and to shoot husbands, fathers, and sons, until he could\\r\\ncompel America to submit to his despotism. The population of England\\r\\nbeing exhausted by those wide spread wars, he hired, of the petty\\r\\nprinces of Europe, innocent peasantry, to abandon their homes in\\r\\nGermany, to burn and destroy the homes of Americans. Finding that not\\r\\nsufficient, he sent his agents through the wilderness to rouse, by\\r\\nbribes, savage men, who knew no better, to ravage our frontiers, to\\r\\nburn the cabins of lonely farmers, to tomahawk and scalp their wives\\r\\nand children.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch a man may be a good Christian. God, who can read the secrets of\\r\\nthe heart, and who is infinite in his love and charity, alone can\\r\\ndecide. But if we imagine that man, George Guelph, at the bar of\\r\\njudgment, and thronging up as witnesses against him, the millions\\r\\nwhose earthly homes he converted into abodes of misery and despair, it\\r\\nis difficult to imagine in our frail natures, how our Heavenly Father,\\r\\nwho loves all his children alike, and who, as revealed in the person\\r\\nof Jesus, could weep over the woes of humanity, could look with a\\r\\nloving smile upon him and say, \"Well done, good and faithful servant,\\r\\nenter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin of course continued in as determined an opposition to the new\\r\\ntax as to the old one. He wrote,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I have some little property in America. I will freely spend\\r\\n     nineteen shillings in the pound to defend my right of giving\\r\\n     or refusing the other shilling. And after all, if I cannot\\r\\n     defend that right, I can retire cheerfully with my little\\r\\n     family into the boundless woods of America, which are sure\\r\\n     to afford freedom and subsistence to any man who can bait a\\r\\n     hook or pull a trigger.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ability which Franklin had displayed as the agent of Pennsylvania\\r\\nbefore the court of St. James, gave him, as we have said, a high\\r\\nreputation in all the colonies. In the spring of 1768 he was highly\\r\\ngratified by the intelligence that he was appointed, by the young\\r\\ncolony of Georgia, its London agent. The next year New Jersey\\r\\nconferred the same honor upon him, and the year after, he was\\r\\nappointed agent of his native province of Massachusetts. These several\\r\\nappointments detained him ten years in England.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring all this time he did not visit home. The equanimity of his\\r\\njoyful spirit seems never to have been disturbed. His pen describes\\r\\nonly pleasant scenes. No murmurs are recorded, no yearnings of\\r\\nhome-sickness.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut month after month the animosity of the British Court towards the\\r\\nAmericans was increasing. The king grew more and more fixed in his\\r\\npurpose, to compel the liberty-loving Americans to submission. Hostile\\r\\nmovements were multiplied to indicate that if the opposition to his\\r\\nmeasures was continued, English fleets and armies would soon commence\\r\\noperations.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral thousand troops were landed in Boston. Fourteen men-of-war\\r\\nwere anchored before the town, with the cannon of their broad-sides\\r\\nloaded and primed, ready, at the slightest provocation to lay the\\r\\nwhole town in ashes. Protected by this terrible menace, two British\\r\\nregiments paraded the streets, with their muskets charged, with\\r\\ngleaming sabres and bayonets, with formidable artillery prepared to\\r\\nvomit forth the most horrible discharges of grape shot, with haughty\\r\\nEnglish officers well mounted, and soldiers and officers alike in\\r\\nimposing uniforms. This invincible band of highly disciplined\\r\\nsoldiers, as a peace measure, took possession of the Common, the State\\r\\nHouse, the Court House and Faneuil Hall.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven now, after the lapse of more than a hundred years, it makes the\\r\\nblood of an American boil to contemplate this insult. Who can imagine\\r\\nthe feelings of exasperation that must have glowed in the bosoms of\\r\\nour patriotic fathers!\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin, in England, was treated with ever increasing disrespect.\\r\\nLord Hillsborough, then in charge of American affairs, told him\\r\\nperemptorily, even insolently, that America could expect no favors\\r\\nwhile he himself was in power, and that he was determined to persevere\\r\\nwith firmness in the policy which the king was pursuing. The king was\\r\\nso shielded by his ministers that Franklin knew but little about him.\\r\\nEven at this time he wrote,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I can scarcely conceive a king of better dispositions, of\\r\\n     more exemplary virtues, or more truly desirous of promoting\\r\\n     the welfare of his subjects.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin never had occasion to speak differently of his domestic\\r\\nvirtues. Nay, it is more than probable that the king daily, in prayer,\\r\\nlooked to God for guidance, and that he thought that he was doing that\\r\\nwhich was promotive of the interests of England. Alas for man! He can\\r\\nperpetrate the most atrocious crimes, honestly believing that he is\\r\\ndoing God\\'s will. He can burn aged women under the charge of their\\r\\nbeing witches. He can torture, in the infliction of unutterable\\r\\nanguish, his brother man--mothers and daughters, under the charge of\\r\\nheresy. He can hurl hundreds of thousands of men against each other in\\r\\nmost horrible and woe-inflicting wars, while falling upon his knees\\r\\nand praying to God to bless his murderous armies.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin had with him his grandson, William Temple Franklin, the\\r\\ndishonored son of William Franklin, then Governor of New Jersey. He\\r\\nwas a bright and promising boy, and developed an estimable character,\\r\\nunder the guidance of his grandfather, who loved him.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam Franklin in New Jersey was, however, becoming increasingly the\\r\\nscourge of his father. It would seem that Providence was thus, in some\\r\\nmeasure, punishing Franklin for his sin. The governor, appointed by\\r\\nthe Court of England to his office, which he highly prized, and which\\r\\nhe feared to lose, was siding with the Court. He perceived that the\\r\\nstorm of political agitation was increasing in severity. He felt that\\r\\nthe power of the colonies was as nothing compared with the power of\\r\\nthe British government. Gradually he became one of the most violent of\\r\\nthe Tories.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moderation of Franklin, and his extraordinarily charitable\\r\\ndisposition, led him to refrain from all denunciations of his\\r\\nungrateful son, or even reproaches, until his conduct became\\r\\nabsolutely infamous. In 1773, he wrote, in reference to the course\\r\\nwhich the governor was pursuing,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I only wish you to act uprightly and steadily, avoiding\\r\\n     that duplicity which, in Hutchinson, adds contempt to\\r\\n     indignation. If you can promote the prosperity of your\\r\\n     people, and leave them happier than you found them, whatever\\r\\n     your political principles are, your memory will be honored.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Franklin was absent, a young merchant of Philadelphia, Richard\\r\\nBache, offered his hand to Franklin\\'s only daughter, from whom the\\r\\nfather had been absent nearly all of her life. Sarah was then\\r\\ntwenty-three years of age, so beautiful as to become quite a\\r\\ncelebrity, and she was highly accomplished. Mr. Bache was not\\r\\nsuccessful in business, and the young couple resided under the roof of\\r\\nMrs. Franklin for eight years. The husband, with an increasing family,\\r\\nappealed to his illustrious father-in-law, to obtain for him a\\r\\ngovernmental appointment. Franklin wrote to his daughter,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I am of opinion, that almost any profession a man has been\\r\\n     educated in, is preferable to an office held at pleasure, as\\r\\n     rendering him more independent, more a free man, and less\\r\\n     subject to the caprices of his superiors. I think that in\\r\\n     keeping a store, if it be where you dwell, you can be\\r\\n     serviceable to him, as your mother was to me; for you are\\r\\n     not deficient in capacity, and I hope you are not too proud.\\r\\n     You might easily learn accounts; and you can copy letters,\\r\\n     or write them very well on occasion. By industry and\\r\\n     frugality you may get forward in the world, being both of\\r\\n     you very young. And then what we may leave you at our death,\\r\\n     will be a pretty addition, though of itself far from\\r\\n     sufficient to maintain and bring up a family.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin gave his son-in-law about a thousand dollars to assist him in\\r\\nthe purchase of a stock of merchandise. The children, born to this\\r\\nhappy couple, were intelligent and beautiful, and they greatly\\r\\ncontributed to the happiness of their grandmother, who cherished them\\r\\nwith a grandmother\\'s most tender love. In the year 1862, there were\\r\\none hundred and ten surviving descendants of Richard Bache and Sarah\\r\\nFranklin. Ten of these were serving in the Union army perilling their\\r\\nlives to maintain that national fabric, which their illustrious\\r\\nancestor had done so much to establish. Franklin was by no means a man\\r\\nof one idea. His comprehensive mind seemed to grasp all questions of\\r\\nstatesmanship, of philanthropy, of philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the ten years of his residence in England he visited the\\r\\nhospitals, carefully examined their management, and transmitted to his\\r\\nhome the result of his observations. This was probably the origin of\\r\\nthe celebrity which the medical schools of Philadelphia have attained.\\r\\nHe visited the silk manufactories, and urged the adoption of that\\r\\nbranch of industry, as peculiarly adapted to our climate and people.\\r\\nEre long he had the pleasure of presenting to the queen a piece of\\r\\nAmerican silk, which she accepted and wore as a dress. As silk was an\\r\\narticle not produced in England, the government was not offended by\\r\\nthe introduction of that branch of industry. For Hartford college he\\r\\nprocured a telescope, which cost about five hundred dollars. This was,\\r\\nin those days, an important event.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe renowned Captain Cook returned from his first voyage around the\\r\\nworld. The narrative of his adventures, in the discovery of new\\r\\nislands, and new races of men, excited almost every mind in England\\r\\nand America. Franklin was prominent in the movement, to raise\\r\\nseventy-five thousand dollars, to fit out an expedition to send to\\r\\nthose benighted islanders the fowls, the quadrupeds and the seeds of\\r\\nEurope. He wrote, in an admirable strain,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Many voyages have been undertaken with views of profit or\\r\\n     of plunder, or to gratify resentment. But a voyage is now\\r\\n     proposed to visit a distant people on the other side of the\\r\\n     globe, not to cheat them, not to rob them: not to seize\\r\\n     their lands or to enslave their persons, but merely to do\\r\\n     them good, and make them, as far as in our power lies, to\\r\\n     live as comfortable as ourselves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere can be no national prosperity without virtue. There can not be a\\r\\nhappy people who do not \"do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with\\r\\nGod.\" It was a noble enterprise to send to those naked savages corn\\r\\nand hoes, with horses, pigs and poultry. But the Christian conscience\\r\\nawoke to the conviction that something more than this was necessary.\\r\\nThey sent, to the dreary huts of the Pacific, ambassadors of the\\r\\nreligion of Jesus, to gather the children in schools, to establish the\\r\\nsanctity of the family relation, and to proclaim to all, the glad\\r\\ntidings of that divine Saviour, who has come to earth \"to seek and to\\r\\nsave the lost.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XI.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The Intolerance of King and Court._\\r\\n\\r\\n     Parties in England--Franklin the favorite of the\\r\\n     opposition--Plans of the Tories--Christian III--Letter of\\r\\n     Franklin--Dr. Priestley--Parisian courtesy--Louis XV--Visit\\r\\n     to Ireland--Attempted alteration of the Prayer Book--Letter\\r\\n     to his son--Astounding letters from America--Words of John\\r\\n     Adams--Petition of the Assembly--Violent conspiracy against\\r\\n     Franklin--His bearing in the court-room--Wedderburn\\'s\\r\\n     infamous charges--Letter of Franklin--Bitter words of Dr.\\r\\n     Johnson--Morals of English lords--Commercial value of the\\r\\n     Colonies--Dangers threatening Franklin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWherever there is a government there must be an opposition. Those who\\r\\nare out of office wish to eject those in office, that they may take\\r\\ntheir places. There was a pretty strong party in what was called the\\r\\nOpposition. But it was composed of persons animated by very different\\r\\nmotives. The first consisted of those intelligent, high minded,\\r\\nvirtuous statesmen, who were indignant in view of the wrong which the\\r\\nhaughty, unprincipled Tory government was inflicting upon the American\\r\\npeople. The second gathered those who were in trade. They cared\\r\\nnothing for the Americans. They cared nothing for government right or\\r\\nwrong. They wished to sell their hats, their cutlery, and their cotton\\r\\nand woolen goods to the Americans. This they could not do while\\r\\ngovernment was despotically enforcing the Stamp Act or the Revenue\\r\\nBill. Then came a third class, who had no goods to sell, and no\\r\\nconscience to guide to action. They were merely ambitious politicians.\\r\\nThey wished to thrust the Tories out of office simply that they might\\r\\nrush into the occupancy of all the places of honor, emolument or\\r\\npower.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin was in high favor with the opposition. He furnished their\\r\\norators in Parliament with arguments, with illustrations, with\\r\\naccurate statistical information. Many of the most telling passages in\\r\\nparliamentary speeches, were placed on the lips of the speakers by\\r\\nBenjamin Franklin. He wrote pamphlets of marvellous popular power,\\r\\nwhich were read in all the workshops, and greatly increased the number\\r\\nand the intelligence of the foes of the government measures. Thus\\r\\nFranklin became the favorite of the popular party. They lavished all\\r\\nhonors upon him. In the same measure he became obnoxious to the\\r\\nhaughty, aristocratic Tory government. Its ranks were filled with the\\r\\nlords, the governmental officials, and all their dependents. This made\\r\\na party very powerful in numbers, and still more powerful in wealth\\r\\nand influence. They were watching for opportunities to traduce\\r\\nFranklin, to ruin his reputation, and if possible, to bring him into\\r\\ncontempt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis will explain the honors which were conferred upon him by one\\r\\nparty, and the indignities to which he was subjected from the other.\\r\\nAt times, the Tories would make efforts by flattery, by offers of\\r\\nposition, of emolument, by various occult forms of bribery, to draw\\r\\nFranklin to their side. He might very easily have attained almost any\\r\\namount of wealth and high official dignity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king of Denmark, Christian VII., was brother-in-law of George III.\\r\\nHe visited England; a mere boy in years, and still more a weak boy in\\r\\ninsipidity of character. A large dinner-party was given in his honor\\r\\nat the Royal Palace. Franklin was one of the guests. In some way\\r\\nunexplained, he impressed the boy-king with a sense of his inherent\\r\\nand peculiar greatness. Christian invited a select circle of but\\r\\nsixteen men to dine with him. Among those thus carefully selected,\\r\\nFranklin was honored with an invitation. Though sixty-seven years of\\r\\nage he still enjoyed in the highest degree, convivial scenes. He could\\r\\ntell stories, and sing songs which gave delight to all. It was his\\r\\nboast that he could empty his two bottles of wine, and still retain\\r\\nentire sobriety. He wrote to Hugh Roberts,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I wish you would continue to meet the Junto. It wants but\\r\\n     about two years of forty since it was established. We loved,\\r\\n     and still love one another; we have grown grey together, and\\r\\n     yet it is too early to part. Let us sit till the evening of\\r\\n     life is spent; the last hours are always the most joyous.\\r\\n     When we can stay no longer, it is time enough to bid each\\r\\n     other good night, separate, and go quietly to bed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin was the last person to find any enjoyment in the society of\\r\\nvulgar and dissolute men. In those days, it was scarcely a reproach\\r\\nfor a young lord to be carried home from a festivity in deadly\\r\\nintoxication. Witticisms were admitted into such circles which\\r\\nrespectable men would not tolerate now. Franklin\\'s most intimate\\r\\nfriends in London were found among Unitarian clergymen, and those\\r\\nphilosophers who were in sympathy with him in his rejection of the\\r\\nChristian religion. Dr. Richard Price, and Dr. Joseph Priestly, men\\r\\nboth eminent for intellectual ability and virtues, were his bosom\\r\\nfriends.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Priestly, who had many conversations with Franklin upon religious\\r\\ntopics, deeply deplored the looseness of his views. Though Dr.\\r\\nPriestly rejected the divinity of Christ, he still firmly adhered to\\r\\nthe belief that Christianity was of divine origin. In his\\r\\nautobiography, Dr. Priestly writes:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"It is much to be lamented that a man of Dr. Franklin\\'s\\r\\n     generally good character and great influence, should have\\r\\n     been an unbeliever in Christianity, and also have done so\\r\\n     much as he did to make others unbelievers. To me, however,\\r\\n     he acknowledged that he had not given so much attention as\\r\\n     he ought to have done to the evidences of Christianity; and\\r\\n     he desired me to recommend him a few treatises on the\\r\\n     subject, such as I thought most deserving his notice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPriestly did so; but Franklin, all absorbed in his social festivities,\\r\\nhis scientific researches, and his intense patriotic labors, could\\r\\nfind no time to devote to that subject--the immortal destiny of\\r\\nman,--which is infinitely more important to each individual than all\\r\\nothers combined.[22] It was indeed a sad circle of unbelievers, into\\r\\nwhose intimacy Franklin was thrown. Dr. Priestly writes,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"In Paris, in 1774, all the philosophical persons to whom I\\r\\n     was introduced, were unbelievers in Christianity, and even\\r\\n     professed atheists. I was told by some of them, that I was\\r\\n     the only person they had ever met, of whose understanding\\r\\n     they had any opinion, who professed to believe in\\r\\n     Christianity. But I soon found they did not really know what\\r\\n     Christianity was.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 22: Mr. Parton, in his excellent Life of Franklin, one of\\r\\nthe best biographies which was ever written, objects to this\\r\\nwithholding of the Christian name from Dr. Franklin. He writes,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I do not understand what Dr. Priestly meant, by saying that\\r\\n     Franklin was an unbeliever in Christianity, since he himself\\r\\n     was open to the same charge from nine-tenths of the\\r\\n     inhabitants of christendom. Perhaps, if the two men were now\\r\\n     alive, we might express the theological difference between\\r\\n     them by saying that Priestly was a Unitarian of the Channing\\r\\n     school, and Franklin of that of Theodore Parker.\" Again he\\r\\n     writes, \"I have ventured to call Franklin the consummate\\r\\n     Christian of his time. Indeed I know not who, of any time,\\r\\n     has exhibited more of the Spirit of Christ.\"--_Parton\\'s\\r\\n     Franklin Vol. 1. p. 546. Vol. 2. p. 646._]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was Franklin\\'s practice to spend a part of every summer in\\r\\ntraveling. In 1767, accompanied by Sir John Pringle, he visited Paris.\\r\\nWith Franklin, one of the first of earthly virtues was courtesy. He\\r\\nwas charmed with the politeness of the French people. Even the most\\r\\nhumble of the working classes, were gentlemanly; and from the highest\\r\\nto the lowest, he, simply as a stranger, was treated with\\r\\nconsideration which surprised him. He writes,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The civilities we everywhere receive, give us the strongest\\r\\n     impressions of the French politeness. It seems to be a point\\r\\n     settled here universally, that strangers are to be treated\\r\\n     with respect; and one has just the same deference shown one\\r\\n     here, by being a stranger, as in England, by being a lady.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo dozen bottles of port-wine were given them at Bordeaux. These, as\\r\\nthe law required, were seized by the custom-house officers, as they\\r\\nentered Paris by the Porte St. Denis; but as soon as it was\\r\\nascertained that they were strangers, the wine was remitted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a magnificent illumination of the Church of Notre Dame, in\\r\\nhonor of the deceased Dauphiness. Thousands could not obtain\\r\\nadmission. An officer, learning merely that they were strangers, took\\r\\nthem in charge, conducted them through the vast edifice, and showed\\r\\nthem every thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin and his companion had the honor of a presentation to the\\r\\nking, Louis XV., at Versailles. This monarch was as vile a man as ever\\r\\noccupied a throne. But he had the virtue of courtesy, which Franklin\\r\\nplaced at the head of religious principle. The philosopher simply\\r\\nrecords,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The king spoke to both of us very graciously and very\\r\\n     cheerfully. He is a handsome man, has a very lively look,\\r\\n     and appears younger than he is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1772, Franklin visited Ireland. He was treated there with great\\r\\nhonor; but the poverty of the Irish peasantry overwhelmed his\\r\\nbenevolent heart with astonishment and dismay. He writes,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I thought often of the happiness of New England, where\\r\\n     every man is a free-holder, has a vote in public affairs,\\r\\n     lives in a tidy, warm house, has plenty of good food and\\r\\n     fuel, with whole clothes from head to foot, the manufacture\\r\\n     perhaps of his own family. Long may they continue in this\\r\\n     situation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the year 1773, Franklin spent several weeks in the beautiful\\r\\nmansion of his friend, Lord Despencer. We read with astonishment,\\r\\nthat Franklin, who openly renounced all belief in the divine origin of\\r\\nChristianity, should have undertaken, with Lord Despencer, an\\r\\nabbreviation of the prayer-book of the Church of England. It is\\r\\nsurprising, that he could have thought it possible, that the eminent\\r\\nChristians, clergy and laity of that church, would accept at the hands\\r\\nof a deist, their form of worship. But Franklin was faithful in the\\r\\nabbreviation, not to make the slightest change in the evangelical\\r\\ncharacter of that admirable work, which through ages has guided the\\r\\ndevotion of millions. The abbreviated service, cut down one-half,\\r\\nattracted no attention, and scarcely a copy was sold.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this time, Franklin\\'s reputation was in its meridian altitude.\\r\\nThere was scarcely a man in Europe or America, more prominent. Every\\r\\nlearned body in Europe, of any importance, had elected him a member.\\r\\nSplendid editions of his works were published in London; and three\\r\\neditions were issued from the press in Paris.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn France, Franklin met with no insults, with no opposition. All alike\\r\\nsmiled upon him, and the voices of commendation alone fell upon his\\r\\near.\\r\\n\\r\\nReturning to England, his reputation there, as a man of high moral\\r\\nworth, and of almost the highest intellectual attainments, and a man\\r\\nhonored in the most remarkable degree with all the highest offices\\r\\nwhich his countrymen could confer upon him, swept contumely from his\\r\\npath, and even his enemies were ashamed to manifest their hostility.\\r\\nFrom London he wrote to his son,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"As to my situation here, nothing can be more agreeable.\\r\\n     Learned and ingenious foreigners that come to England,\\r\\n     almost all make a point of visiting me; for my reputation is\\r\\n     still higher abroad, than here. Several of the foreign\\r\\n     ambassadors have assiduously cultivated my acquaintance,\\r\\n     treating me as one of their corps, partly, I believe, from\\r\\n     the desire they have from time to time, of hearing something\\r\\n     of American affairs; an object become of importance in\\r\\n     foreign courts, who begin to hope Britain\\'s alarming power\\r\\n     will be diminished by the defection of her colonies.\"[23]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 23: \"For dinner parties Franklin was in such demand that,\\r\\nduring the London season, he sometimes dined out six days in the\\r\\nweek for several weeks together. He also confesses that occasionally\\r\\nhe drank more wine than became a philosopher. It would indeed have\\r\\nbeen extremely difficult to avoid it, in that soaking age, when\\r\\na man\\'s force was reckoned by the number of bottles he could\\r\\nempty.\"--_Parton\\'s Life of Franklin_, Vol. i, p. 540.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an illustration of the state of the times, I give the following\\r\\nverse from one of the songs which Franklin wrote, and which he was\\r\\naccustomed to sing with great applause. At the meetings of the Junto,\\r\\nall the club joined in the chorus,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Fair Venus calls; her voice obey\\r\\n     In beauty\\'s arms spend night and day.\\r\\n     The joys of love all joys excel,\\r\\n     And loving\\'s certainly doing well.\\r\\n\\r\\n           _Chorus._\\r\\n\\r\\n       Oh! no!\\r\\n       Not so!\\r\\n       For honest souls still know\\r\\n       Friends and the bottle still bear the bell.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is well,\" Mr. Parton writes, \"for us, in these days, to consider\\r\\nthe spectacle of this large, robust soul, sporting in this simple,\\r\\nhomely way. This superb Franklin of ours, who spent some evenings in\\r\\nmere jollity, passed nearly all his days in labor most fruitful of\\r\\nbenefit to his country.\"--_Life of Franklin_, Vol. i, p. 262.]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the latter part of the year 1772, Franklin, in his ever courteous,\\r\\nbut decisive language, was conversing with an influential member of\\r\\nParliament, respecting the violent proceedings of the ministry, in\\r\\nquartering troops upon the citizens of Boston. The member, in reply,\\r\\nsaid,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are deceived in supposing these measures to originate with the\\r\\nministry. The sending out of the troops, and all the hostile measures,\\r\\nof which you complain, have not only been suggested, but solicited, by\\r\\nprominent men of your own country. They have urged that troops should\\r\\nbe sent, and that fleets should enter your harbors, declaring that in\\r\\nno other way, than by this menace of power, can the turbulent\\r\\nAmericans be brought to see their guilt and danger, and return to\\r\\nobedience.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin expressed his doubts of this statement. \"I will bring you\\r\\nproof,\" the gentleman replied. A few days after, he visited Franklin,\\r\\nand brought with him a packet of letters, written by persons of high\\r\\nofficial station in the colonies, and native born Americans. The\\r\\nsignatures of these letters were effaced; but the letters themselves\\r\\nwere presented, and Franklin was confidentially informed of their\\r\\nwriters. They were addressed to Mr. William Whately, an influential\\r\\nmember of Parliament, who had recently died.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin read them with astonishment and indignation. He found the\\r\\nrepresentation of the gentleman entirely true. Six of the letters were\\r\\nwritten by Thomas Hutchinson, Governor of Massachusetts. He was a\\r\\nnative of the colony he governed, a graduate of Harvard, and in his\\r\\nreligious position a Puritan. Four were written by Andrew Oliver,\\r\\nLieutenant-governor, and also a native of Massachusetts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest were written by custom-house officers and other servants of\\r\\nthe Crown. The openly avowed design of these letters was, that they\\r\\nshould be exhibited to the Ministry, to excite them to prompt,\\r\\nvigorous and hostile measures. They teemed with misrepresentations,\\r\\nand often with downright falsehoods. The perusal of these infamous\\r\\nproductions elicited from Franklin first a burst of indignation. The\\r\\nsecond effect was greatly to mitigate his resentment against the\\r\\nBritish government. The ministry, it seemed, were acting in\\r\\naccordance with solicitations received from Americans, native born,\\r\\nand occupying the highest posts of honor and influence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gentleman who obtained these letters and showed them to Franklin,\\r\\nwas very unwilling to have his agency in the affair made public. After\\r\\nmuch solicitation, he consented to have Franklin send the letters to\\r\\nAmerica, though he would not give permission to have any copies taken.\\r\\nIt was his hope, that the letters would calm the rising animosity in\\r\\nAmerica, by showing that the British ministry was pursuing a course of\\r\\nmenace, which many of the most distinguished Americans declared to be\\r\\nessential, to save the country from anarchy and ruin. Franklin\\'s\\r\\nobject was to cause these traitorous office-holders to be ejected from\\r\\ntheir positions of influence, that others, more patriotic, might\\r\\noccupy the stations which they disgraced.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 2d of December, 1772, Franklin inclosed the letters in an\\r\\nofficial package, directed to Thomas Cushing. He wrote,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I am not at liberty to make the letters public. I can only\\r\\n     allow them to be seen by yourself, by the other gentlemen of\\r\\n     the Committee of Correspondence, by Messrs. Bowdoin and\\r\\n     Pitts of the Council, and Drs. Chauncy, Cooper, and\\r\\n     Winthrop, and a few such other gentlemen as you may think\\r\\n     fit to show them to. After being some months in your\\r\\n     possession, you are requested to return them to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reading of the letters created intense anger and disgust. John\\r\\nAdams, after perusing them, recorded in his diary, alluding to\\r\\nHutchinson, \"Cool, thinking deliberate villain, malicious and\\r\\nvindictive.\" He carried the documents around to read to all his male\\r\\nand female friends, and was not sparing in his vehement comments.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain he wrote, \"Bone of our bone; born and educated among us! Mr.\\r\\nHancock is deeply affected; is determined, in conjunction with Major\\r\\nHawley, to watch the vile serpent, and his deputy, Brattle. The\\r\\nsubtlety of this serpent is equal to that of the old one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor two months the letters were privately yet extensively circulated.\\r\\nHutchinson himself soon found out the storm which was gathering\\r\\nagainst him. The hand-writing of all the writers was known. In June,\\r\\nthe Massachusetts Assembly met. In secret session the letters were\\r\\nread. Soon some copies were printed. It was said that some one had\\r\\nobtained, from England, copies of the letters from which the printed\\r\\nimpressions were taken. But the mystery of their publication was never\\r\\nsolved.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Assembly sent a petition to the king of England, imploring that\\r\\nThomas Hutchinson and Andrew Oliver, should be removed from their\\r\\nposts, and that such good men as the king might select, should be\\r\\nplaced in their stead. The petition, eminently respectful, but drawn\\r\\nup in very forcible language, expressive of the ruinous consequences\\r\\ncaused by the measures which these officials had recommended, was\\r\\ntransmitted to Franklin, the latter part of the summer of 1773. He\\r\\nimmediately forwarded it to Lord Dartmouth. With it he sent a very\\r\\npolite and conciliatory letter, in which he declared, that the\\r\\nAmericans were very desirous of being on good terms with the mother\\r\\ncountry, that their resentment against the government was greatly\\r\\nabated, by finding that Americans had urged the obnoxious measures\\r\\nwhich had been adopted; and that the present was a very favorable time\\r\\nto introduce cordial, friendly relations between the king and the\\r\\ncolonists.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Dartmouth returned a very polite reply, laid the all-important\\r\\npetition aside, and for five months never alluded to it, by word or\\r\\nletter. In the meantime, some of the printed copies reached London.\\r\\nThe Tories thought that perhaps the long sought opportunity had come\\r\\nwhen they might pounce upon Franklin, and at least greatly impair his\\r\\ninfluence. Franklin had nothing to conceal. He had received the\\r\\nletters from a friend, who authorized him to send them to America,\\r\\nthat their contents might be made known there.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn all this he had done absolutely nothing, which any one could\\r\\npronounce to be wrong. But the Court, being determined to stir up\\r\\nstrife, began to demand who it was that had obtained and delivered\\r\\nup the letters. Franklin was absent from London. He soon heard tidings\\r\\nof the great commotion that was excited, and that two gentlemen, who\\r\\nhad nothing to do with the matter, were each accused of having\\r\\ndishonorably obtained the letters. This led to a duel. Franklin\\r\\nimmediately wrote,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I think it incumbent for me to declare that I alone am the\\r\\n     person who obtained and transmitted to Boston, the letters\\r\\n     in question.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Court decided to summon Franklin to meet the \"Committee for\\r\\nPlantation Affairs,\" to explain the reasons for the petition against\\r\\nHutchinson and Oliver. To the surprise of Franklin, it appeared that\\r\\nthey were organizing quite a formidable trial; and very able counsel\\r\\nwas appointed to defend the culprits.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus Franklin, who simply presented the petition of the Assembly, was\\r\\nforced into the obnoxious position of a prosecutor. The array against\\r\\nhim was so strong, that it became necessary for him also to have\\r\\ncounsel. It was manifest to all the friends of Franklin, that the\\r\\nBritish Court was rousing all its energies to crush him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe meeting was held on the 11th of January, 1773. Four of the Cabinet\\r\\nministers were present, and several Lords of the Privy Council. They\\r\\naddressed Franklin as a culprit, who had brought slanderous charges\\r\\nagainst his majesty\\'s faithful officers in the colonies. He was\\r\\ntreated not only with disrespect but with absolute insolence. But\\r\\nnothing could disturb his equanimity. Not for one moment did he lose\\r\\nserenity of mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was an adjournment, to meet on the 29th of the month. In the\\r\\nmeantime one of the court party, who had received many favors from\\r\\nFranklin, commenced a chancery suit against him, accusing him of\\r\\nstealing the letters, and being by trade a printer, of having secretly\\r\\npublished them, and sold immense numbers, the profits of which he had\\r\\nplaced in his own pocket. All this Franklin denied on oath. The charge\\r\\nwas so absurd, and so manifestly malignant, that his foes withdrew the\\r\\nsuit. Franklin was however assured that the Court was clamoring for\\r\\nhis punishment and disgrace.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll London was agitated by the commotion which these extraordinary\\r\\nevents created. At the appointed day, the Council again met. The\\r\\nassembly was held in a large apartment in the drawing-room style. At\\r\\none end was the entrance door; at the other the fire-place, with\\r\\nrecesses on each side of the chimney. A broad table extended from the\\r\\nfire-place to the door. The Privy Council, thirty-five in number, sat\\r\\nat this table. They were inveterate Tories, resolved to bring the\\r\\nAmericans down upon their knees, and, as a preliminary step, to\\r\\ninflict indelible disgrace upon Franklin. Lord North, the implacable\\r\\nPrime Minister was there. The Archbishop of Canterbury was present. As\\r\\nFranklin cast his eye along the line of these haughty nobles, he could\\r\\nnot see the face of a friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe remainder of the room was crowded with spectators. From them many\\r\\na sympathizing glance fell upon him. Priestly and Burke gave him their\\r\\nsilent but cordial sympathy. There were also quite a number of\\r\\nAmericans and prominent members of the opposition, whose presence was\\r\\na support to Franklin, during the ordeal through which he was to pass.\\r\\nHe stood at the edge of the recess formed by the chimney, with one\\r\\nelbow resting upon the mantel, and his cheek upon his hand. He was\\r\\nmotionless as a statue, and had composed his features into such calm\\r\\nand serene rigidity, that not the movement of a muscle could be\\r\\ndetected. As usual, he was dressed simply, but with great elegance. A\\r\\nlarge flowing wig, with abundant curls, such as were used by elderly\\r\\ngentlemen at that day, covered his head. His costume, which was\\r\\nadmirably fitted to a form as perfect as Grecian sculptor ever\\r\\nchiseled, was of rich figured silk velvet. In all that room, there was\\r\\nnot an individual, who in physical beauty, was the peer of Franklin.\\r\\nIn all that room there was not another, who in intellectual greatness\\r\\ncould have met the trial so grandly.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will be remembered that the Assembly of Massachusetts had\\r\\npetitioned for the removal of an obnoxious governor and lieutenant\\r\\ngovernor. Franklin, as the agent in London of that colony, had\\r\\npresented the petition to the crown. He was now summoned to appear\\r\\nbefore the privy council, to bring forward and substantiate charges\\r\\nagainst these officers. The council had appointed a lawyer to defend\\r\\nHutchinson and Oliver. His name was Wedderburn. He had already\\r\\nobtained celebrity for the savage skill with which he could browbeat a\\r\\nwitness, and for his wonderful command of the vocabulary of\\r\\nvituperation and abuse. Before commencing the examination, he\\r\\naddressed the assembly in a long speech. After eulogizing Governor\\r\\nHutchinson, as one of the best and most loyal of the officers of the\\r\\ncrown, who merited the gratitude of king and court, he turned upon\\r\\nFranklin, and assailed him with a storm of vituperative epithets,\\r\\nsuch as never before, and never since, has fallen upon the head of a\\r\\nman. The council were in sympathy with the speaker. Often his\\r\\nmalignant thrusts would elicit from those lords a general shout of\\r\\nderisive laughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was the treatment which one of the most illustrious and honored\\r\\nof American citizens received from the privy council of king George\\r\\nIII., when he appeared before that council as a friendly ambassador\\r\\nfrom his native land, seeking only conciliation and peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nWedderburn accused Franklin of stealing private letters, of\\r\\nmisrepresenting their contents, that he might excite hostility against\\r\\nthe loyal officers of the king. He accused him of doing this that he\\r\\nmight eject them from office, so as to obtain the positions for\\r\\nhimself and his friends. Still more, he accused him of having in an\\r\\nunexampled spirit of meanness, availed himself of his skill as a\\r\\nprinter, to publish these letters, and that he sold them far and wide,\\r\\nthat he might enrich himself. Charges better calculated to ruin a man,\\r\\nin the view of these proud lords, can scarcely be conceived. It is\\r\\ndoubtful whether there were another man in the world, who could have\\r\\nreceived them so calmly, and in the end could have so magnificently\\r\\ntriumphed over them.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring all this really terrific assailment, Franklin stood with his\\r\\nhead resting on his left hand, apparently unmoved. At the close, he\\r\\ndeclined answering any questions. The committee of the council\\r\\nreported on that same day, \"the lords of the committee, do agree\\r\\nhumbly to report as their opinion to your majesty, that the said\\r\\npetition is founded upon resolution\\'s, formed upon false and erroneous\\r\\nallegations, and that the same is false, vexatious and scandalous; and\\r\\ncalculated only for the seditious purposes of keeping up a spirit of\\r\\nclamor and discontent in said province.\" The king accepted the report,\\r\\nand acted accordingly. Franklin went home alone. We know not why his\\r\\nfriends thus apparently deserted him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning, which was Sunday, Priestly breakfasted at Franklin\\'s\\r\\ntable. He represents him as saying that he could not have borne\\r\\nthe insults heaped upon him by the privy council, but for the\\r\\nconsciousness, that he had done only that which was right. On Monday\\r\\nmorning Franklin received a laconic letter from the Postmaster\\r\\nGeneral, informing him that the king had found it necessary to dismiss\\r\\nhim from the office of deputy Postmaster General in America.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis outrage, inflicted by the privy council of Great Britain, upon a\\r\\nfriendly ambassador from her colonies, who had visited her court with\\r\\nthe desire to promote union and harmony, was one of the most\\r\\natrocious acts ever perpetrated by men above the rank of vagabonds in\\r\\ntheir drunken carousals. Franklin, in transmitting an account to\\r\\nMassachusetts, writes in a noble strain:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"What I feel on my own account, is half lost in what I feel\\r\\n     for the public. When I see that all petitions and complaints\\r\\n     of grievances, are so odious to government, that even the\\r\\n     mere pipe which conveys them, becomes obnoxious, I am at a\\r\\n     loss to know how peace and union are to be maintained, and\\r\\n     restored between the different parts of the empire.\\r\\n     Grievances cannot be redressed, unless they are known. And\\r\\n     they cannot be known, but through complaints and petitions.\\r\\n     If these are deemed affronts, and the messengers punished as\\r\\n     offenders, who will henceforth send petitions? and who will\\r\\n     deliver them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe speech of Wedderburn gave great delight to all the Tory party. It\\r\\nwas derisively said, \"that the lords of the council, went to their\\r\\nchamber, as to a bull-baiting, and hounded on the Solicitor General\\r\\nwith loud applause and laughter.\" Mr. Fox, writing of the assault\\r\\nsaid, \"All men tossed up their hats and clapped their hands, in\\r\\nboundless delight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the tidings of the affair reached America, it added intensity to\\r\\nthe animosity, then rapidly increasing, against the British\\r\\ngovernment. The dismissal of Franklin from the post-office, was deemed\\r\\nequivalent to the seizure, by the crown, of that important branch of\\r\\nthe government. None but the creatures of the Ministry were to be\\r\\npostmasters. Consequently patriotic Americans could no longer entrust\\r\\ntheir letters to the mail. Private arrangements were immediately made\\r\\nfor the conveyance of letters; and with so much efficiency, that the\\r\\ngeneral office, which had heretofore contributed fifteen thousand\\r\\ndollars annually to the public treasury, never after paid into it one\\r\\nfarthing.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 24: It may be worthy of record, that Wedderburn became the\\r\\nhero of the clubs and the favorite of the Tory party. Wealth and\\r\\nhonors were lavished upon him. He rose to the dignity of an earl and\\r\\nlord chancellor, and yet we do not find, in any of the annals of those\\r\\ndays, that he is spoken of otherwise than as a shallow, unprincipled\\r\\nman. When his death, after a few hours\\' illness, was announced to the\\r\\nking, he scornfully said, \"He has not left a worse man behind him.\"]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spirit of the Tories may be inferred from that of one of the most\\r\\napplauded and influential of their leaders. Dr. Samuel Johnson, who\\r\\nwrote the notorious \"Taxation no Tyranny,\" said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Americans are a race of convicts. They ought to be thankful for\\r\\nany thing we can give them. I am willing to love all mankind except\\r\\nan American.\" Boswell in quoting one of his insane tirades writes,\\r\\n\"His inflammable corruption, bursting into horrid fire, he breathed\\r\\nout threatenings and slaughter, calling them rascals, robbers,\\r\\npirates, and exclaiming that he would burn and destroy them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a day of vicious indulgence, of dissipation in every form, when\\r\\nit was fashionable to be godless, and to sneer at all the restraints\\r\\nof the Christian religion. Volumes might be filled with accounts of\\r\\nthe atrocities perpetrated by drunken lords at the gaming table and in\\r\\nmidnight revel through the streets. Such men of influence and rank as\\r\\nFox, Lord Derby, the Duke of Ancaster, inflamed with wine, could set\\r\\nthe police at defiance. They were constantly engaged in orgies which\\r\\nwould disgrace the most degraded wretches, in the vilest haunts of\\r\\ninfamy in our cities. Instead of gambling for copper, they gambled for\\r\\ngold. Horace Walpole testifies that at one of the most fashionable\\r\\nclubs, at Almack\\'s, they played only for rouleaux of two hundred and\\r\\nfifty dollars each. There were often fifty thousand dollars in specie\\r\\non the gaming tables, around which these bloated inebriates were\\r\\ngathered. It is said that Lord Holland paid the gambling debts of his\\r\\ntwo sons to the amount of one hundred thousand dollars.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trade of the colonies had become of immense value to the mother\\r\\ncountry. It amounted to six and a half millions sterling a year.\\r\\nPhiladelphia numbered forty thousand inhabitants. Charleston, South\\r\\nCarolina, had become one of the most beautiful and healthy cities in\\r\\nAmerica. The harbor was crowded with shipping, the streets were lined\\r\\nwith mansions of great architectural beauty. Gorgeous equipages were\\r\\nseen, almost rivaling the display in French and English capitals. But\\r\\nthere were many Tories in Charleston, as malignant in their opposition\\r\\nto the popular cause in America, as any of the aristocrats to be found\\r\\nin London.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe unpardonable insult which Franklin had received, closed his\\r\\nofficial labors in London. His personal friends and the Opposition\\r\\nrallied more affectionately than ever around him. But he ceased to\\r\\nappear at court and was seldom present at the dinner-parties of the\\r\\nministers. Still he was constantly and efficiently employed in behalf\\r\\nof his country. The leaders of the opposition were in constant\\r\\nconference with him. He wrote many pamphlets and published articles in\\r\\nthe journals, which exerted an extended and powerful influence. He\\r\\nwrote to his friends at home, in October, 1774,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"My situation here is thought, by many, to be a little\\r\\n     hazardous; for if by some accident the troops and people of\\r\\n     New England should come to blows, I should probably be\\r\\n     taken up; the ministerial people, affecting everywhere to\\r\\n     represent me as the cause of all the misunderstanding. And I\\r\\n     have been frequently cautioned to secure all my papers, and\\r\\n     by some advised to withdraw. But I venture to stay, in\\r\\n     compliance with the wish of others, till the result of the\\r\\n     Congress arrives, since they suppose my being here might, on\\r\\n     that occasion, be of use. And I confide in my innocence,\\r\\n     that the worst that can happen to me will be an imprisonment\\r\\n     upon suspicion; though that is a thing I should much desire\\r\\n     to avoid, as it may be expensive and vexatious, as well as\\r\\n     dangerous to my health.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XII.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The Bloodhounds of War Unleashed._\\r\\n\\r\\n     The mission of Josiah Quincy--Love of England by the\\r\\n     Americans--Petition to the king--Sickness and death of Mrs.\\r\\n     Franklin--Lord Chatham--His speech in favor of the\\r\\n     colonists--Lord Howe--His interview with Franklin--Firmness\\r\\n     of Franklin--His indignation--His mirth--Franklin\\'s\\r\\n     fable--He embarks for Philadelphia--Feeble condition of the\\r\\n     colonies--England\\'s expressions of contempt--Franklin\\'s\\r\\n     reception at Philadelphia--His letter to Edmund\\r\\n     Burke--Post-office arrangements--Defection and conduct of\\r\\n     William Franklin--His arrest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYoung Josiah Quincy, of Boston, one of the noblest of patriots, who\\r\\nwas dying of consumption, visited London, with instructions to confer\\r\\nwith Franklin upon the posture of affairs. He wrote home, in the most\\r\\ncommendatory terms, of the zeal and sagacity with which Franklin was\\r\\ndevoting himself to the interests of his country. Tory spies were\\r\\nwatching his every movement, and listening to catch every word which\\r\\nfell from his lips. Lord Hillsborough, in a debate in the House of\\r\\nLords, said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are two men, walking in the streets of London, who ought to be\\r\\nin Newgate or at Tyburn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe duke of Richmond demanded their names, saying that if such were\\r\\nthe fact the ministry were severely to be blamed. Hillsborough\\r\\ndeclined to give their names; but it was generally known that he\\r\\nreferred to Dr. Franklin and Josiah Quincy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe policy of Franklin was clearly defined, and unchanging. He said\\r\\nvirtually, to his countrymen, \"Perform no political act against the\\r\\ngovernment, utter no menace, and do no act of violence whatever. But\\r\\nfirmly and perseveringly unite in consuming no English goods. There is\\r\\nnothing in this which any one will pronounce to be, in the slightest\\r\\ndegree, illegal. The sudden and total loss of the trade with America,\\r\\nwill, in one year, create such a clamor, from the capitalists and\\r\\nindustrial classes of England, Ireland and Scotland, that the despotic\\r\\ngovernment will be compelled to retrace its steps.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEven at this time the Americans had no desire to break loose from the\\r\\ngovernment of Great Britain. England was emphatically their home.\\r\\nEnglishmen were their brothers. In England their fathers were gathered\\r\\nto the grave. The Americans did not assume a new name. They still\\r\\ncalled themselves Englishmen. They were proud to be members of the\\r\\nmajestic kingdom, which then stood at the head of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nCongress met. Its members, perhaps without exception, were yearning\\r\\nfor reconciliation with the mother-country, and for sincere and\\r\\ncordial friendship. It was resolved to make another solemn appeal to\\r\\nthe king, whom they had ever been accustomed to revere, and, in a\\r\\nfraternal spirit, to address their brethren, the people of England,\\r\\nwhom they wished to regard with all the respect due to elder brothers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe intelligence of Christendom has applauded the dignity and the\\r\\npathos of these documents. The appeal fell upon the profane, gambling,\\r\\nwine-bloated aristocrats of the court, as if it had been addressed to\\r\\nthe marble statuary in the British Museum. Nay worse. Those statues\\r\\nwould have listened in respectful silence. No contemptuous laughter,\\r\\nand no oaths of menace, would have burst from their marble lips. The\\r\\nfollowing brief extract will show the spirit which pervaded these\\r\\nnoble documents. It is one of the closing sentences of the address to\\r\\nthe king:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Permit us then, most gracious sovereign, in the name of all\\r\\n     your faithful people in America, with the utmost humility to\\r\\n     implore you, for the honor of Almighty God, whose pure\\r\\n     religion our enemies are undermining; for the glory which\\r\\n     can be advanced only by rendering your subjects happy and\\r\\n     keeping them united; for the interests of your family,\\r\\n     depending on an adherence to the principle that enthroned\\r\\n     it; for the safety and welfare of your kingdom and\\r\\n     dominions, threatened with unavoidable dangers, and\\r\\n     distresses; that your majesty, as the loving father of your\\r\\n     whole people, connected by the same bands of law, loyalty,\\r\\n     faith and blood, though dwelling in various countries, will\\r\\n     not suffer the transcendent relation, formed by these ties,\\r\\n     to be further violated, in uncertain expectation of effects\\r\\n     which, if attained, never can compensate for the calamities\\r\\n     through which they must be gained.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis petition was sent to Franklin, and the other colony agents, to be\\r\\npresented by them to the king. They were instructed also to publish\\r\\nboth the Petition and the Address, in the newspapers, and to give them\\r\\nas wide a circulation as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Franklin, with two other agents, Arthur Lee and Mr. Bollan,\\r\\npresented to Lord Dartmouth the petition to be handed by him to the\\r\\nking. They were soon informed that the king received it graciously,\\r\\nand would submit the consideration of it to Parliament. It was thought\\r\\nnot respectful to the king to publish it before he had presented it to\\r\\nthat body. But as usual, the infatuation of both king and court was\\r\\nsuch, that everything that came from the Americans was treated with\\r\\nneglect, if not with contempt. The all-important petition was buried\\r\\nin a pile of documents upon all conceivable subjects, and not one\\r\\nword was said to commend it to the consideration of either house. For\\r\\nthree days it remained unnoticed. Dr. Franklin, then, with his two\\r\\ncompanions, solicited permission to be heard at the bar of the house.\\r\\nTheir request was refused. This brought the question into debate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe House of Commons was at that time but a reflected image of the\\r\\nHouse of Lords. It was composed almost exclusively, of the younger\\r\\nsons of the nobles, and such other obsequious servants of the\\r\\naristocracy, as they, with their vast wealth and patronage, saw fit to\\r\\nhave elected. There was an immense Tory majority in the House. They\\r\\nassailed the petition with vulgarity of abuse, which could scarcely be\\r\\nexceeded; and then dismissed it from further consideration. Noble\\r\\nlords made themselves merry in depicting the alacrity with which a\\r\\nwhole army of Americans would disperse at the very sound of a British\\r\\ncannon.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile these disastrous events were taking place in England--events,\\r\\nsure to usher in a cruel and bloody war, bearing on its wings terror\\r\\nand conflagration, tears and blood, a domestic tragedy was taking\\r\\nplace in the far distant home of Franklin on the banks of the\\r\\nDelaware. Mrs. Franklin had been separated from her husband for nearly\\r\\nten years. She was a cheerful, motherly woman, ever blessing her home\\r\\nwith smiles and with kindly words; and in the society of her daughter\\r\\nand her grandchildren, she found a constant joy. The lapse of\\r\\nthree-score years and ten, had not brought their usual infirmities.\\r\\nThough yearning intensely for the return of her husband, she did not\\r\\nallow the separation seriously to mar her happiness. Every spring she\\r\\nwas confident that he would return the next autumn, and then bore her\\r\\ndisappointment bravely in the assurance that she should see him the\\r\\ncoming spring.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December, 1774, she was suddenly stricken down by a paralytic\\r\\nstroke. Five days of unconscious slumber passed away, when she fell\\r\\ninto that deep and dreamless sleep, which has no earthly waking. Her\\r\\nfuneral was attended by a large concourse of citizens, with every\\r\\ntestimonial of respect. Some of Franklin\\'s oldest friends bore the\\r\\ncoffin to the churchyard, where the remains of the affectionate wife\\r\\nand mother who had so nobly fulfilled life\\'s duties, were placed by\\r\\nthe side of her father, her mother, and her infant son.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeelingly does Mr. Parton write, \"It is mournful to think that for so\\r\\nmany years, she should have been deprived of her husband\\'s society.\\r\\nThe very qualities which made her so good a wife, rendered it\\r\\npossible for him to remain absent from his affairs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin, all unconscious of the calamity which had darkened his home,\\r\\nand weary of the conflict with the British court, was eagerly making\\r\\npreparations to return to Philadelphia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe aged, illustrious, eloquent Earl of Chatham, one of the noblest of\\r\\nEngland\\'s all grasping and ambitious sons, sought an interview with\\r\\nFranklin. He utterly condemned the policy of the British cabinet. His\\r\\nsympathies were, not only from principles of policy, but from\\r\\nconvictions of justice, cordially with the Americans. He felt sure\\r\\nthat unless the court should retrace its steps, war would ensue, and\\r\\nAmerican Independence would follow, and that England, with the loss of\\r\\nher colonies, would find mercantile impoverishment and political\\r\\nweakness. In the course of conversation, he implied that America might\\r\\nbe even then, contemplating independence. Franklin, in his account of\\r\\nthe interview writes,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I assured him that having more than once traveled almost\\r\\n     from one end of the continent to the other, and kept a great\\r\\n     variety of company, eating, drinking and conversing with\\r\\n     them freely, I had never heard in any conversation from any\\r\\n     person, drunk or sober, the least expression of a wish for a\\r\\n     separation, or a hint that such a thing would be\\r\\n     advantageous to America.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a subsequent interview, the Earl of Chatham, alluding to the\\r\\nconduct of Congress, in drawing up the petition and address, said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They have acted with so much temper, moderation and wisdom, that I\\r\\nthink it the most honorable assembly of statesmen since those of the\\r\\nGreeks and Romans, of the most virtuous times.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a subsequent interview, Dr. Franklin expressed, to the earl, his\\r\\napprehension that the continuance of the British army in Boston, which\\r\\nwas the source of constant irritation to the people, might eventually\\r\\nlead to a quarrel, perhaps between a drunken porter and a soldier, and\\r\\nthat thus tumult and bloodshed might be introduced, leading to\\r\\nconsequences which no one could foresee.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Chatham felt the force of these remarks, which soon received\\r\\ntheir striking illustration, in what was called the Boston Massacre.\\r\\nHe therefore declared his intention of repairing to the House of\\r\\nLords, to introduce a resolve for the immediate withdrawal of the\\r\\ntroops from Boston. The tidings were soon noised abroad that the\\r\\neloquent earl, then probably the most illustrious man in England, was\\r\\nto make a speech in favor of America. The eventful day arrived. The\\r\\nhall was crowded. Dr. Franklin had a special invitation from the earl\\r\\nto be present. The friends of America were there, few in numbers, and\\r\\nthe enemies in all their strength.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Chatham made a speech, which in logical power and glowing\\r\\neloquence, has perhaps never been surpassed. Franklin had impressed\\r\\nhim with the conviction that the determination of the Americans to\\r\\ndefend their rights was such, that if, with fleet and army, the\\r\\ngovernment were to ravage all the coast and burn all the cities, the\\r\\nAmericans would retreat back into the forests, in the maintenance of\\r\\ntheir liberty. Full of this idea, Lord Chatham exclaimed, with\\r\\nprophetic power,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall be forced ultimately to retract. Let us retract while we\\r\\ncan, not when we must. I say we must necessarily undo these violent\\r\\noppressive acts. You will repeal them. I pledge myself for it. I stake\\r\\nmy reputation on it. I will consent to be taken for an idiot, if they\\r\\nare not finally repealed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin writes, \"All availed no more than the whistling of the wind.\\r\\nThe motion was rejected. Sixteen Scotch peers and twenty-four bishops,\\r\\nwith all the lords in possession or expectation of places, when they\\r\\nvote together unanimously for ministerial measures, as they generally\\r\\ndo, make a dead majority, that renders all debate ridiculous in\\r\\nitself, since it can answer no end.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the speech produced no impression upon the obdurate House of\\r\\nLords, it had a very powerful effect upon the public mind. It was read\\r\\nin America, in collegiate halls, in the work-shop and at the farmer\\'s\\r\\nfireside, with delight which cannot be described. A few days after the\\r\\nspeech, Dr. Franklin, writing to Lord Stanhope, said,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Dr. Franklin is filled with admiration of that truly great\\r\\n     man. He has seen, in the course of life, sometimes eloquence\\r\\n     without wisdom, and often wisdom without eloquence; in the\\r\\n     present instance he sees both united, and both he thinks in\\r\\n     the highest degree possible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSlowly the ministry were awaking to the conviction that American\\r\\naffairs, if not settled, might yet cause them much trouble. In various\\r\\nunderhand ways, they approached Franklin. It was generally understood\\r\\nthat every man had his price; that the influence of one man could be\\r\\nbought for a few hundred pounds; that another would require a\\r\\nlucrative and honorable office. Though the reputation of Franklin was\\r\\nsuch, that it was a delicate matter to approach him with bribes, still\\r\\nsome of them now commenced a course of flattery, endeavoring to secure\\r\\nhis coÃ¶peration. It was thought that his influence with his countrymen\\r\\nwas so great, that they would accede to any terms he should recommend.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Howe called upon Franklin, and, in the name of Lord North and\\r\\nLord Dartmouth, the two most influential members of the ministry,\\r\\ninformed him that they sincerely sought reconciliation, and that they\\r\\nwere prepared to listen favorably, to any reasonable propositions he\\r\\nmight offer. Lord Howe was the friend of Franklin and of America.\\r\\nThese unexpected and joyful tidings affected Franklin so deeply, that\\r\\nhe could not conceal the tears which rolled down his cheeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Howe then added that he was instructed to say, that the service\\r\\nhe would thus render both England and America, would be of priceless\\r\\nvalue, and that though the ministers could not think of influencing\\r\\nhim by any selfish motives, he might expect, in return, _any reward\\r\\nwhich it was in the power of government to bestow_. \"This,\" said\\r\\nFranklin, \"was what the French vulgarly called _spitting in the\\r\\nsoup_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut again there was a meeting of Parliament. Again it became evident\\r\\nthat the ministry would accede to no terms, which did not secure the\\r\\nentire subjugation of America. Lord Chatham made a renewed attempt to\\r\\nconciliate. His propositions were rejected with scorn. In the meantime\\r\\nDr. Franklin had presented some Hints, drawn up in the most liberal\\r\\nspirit of compromise, but which still maintained the American\\r\\nprinciple, that the colonists could not be taxed at the pleasure of\\r\\nthe court, without having any voice themselves in the amount which\\r\\nthey were to pay.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after this, Mr. Barclay called upon Franklin in the name of the\\r\\ngovernment, and after a long, and to Franklin, disgusting diplomatic\\r\\nharangue, ventured to say to him, that if he would only comply with\\r\\nthe wishes of the ministry, he might expect almost any reward he could\\r\\nwish for. Even the imperturbable spirit of Franklin was roused. He\\r\\nreplied,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The ministry, I am sure, would rather give me a place in a cart to\\r\\nTyburn, than any other place whatever. I sincerely wish to be\\r\\nserviceable; and I need no other inducement that I might be so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another interview, which soon followed, it appeared that the\\r\\ngovernment refused to concede a single point which the Americans\\r\\ndeemed essential. They refused to withdraw the troops; refused to\\r\\nallow the colonial governors to appoint the collectors of the customs;\\r\\npersisted in building fortresses to hold the people in subjection; and\\r\\nadhered to the claim of Parliament to legislate for the colonies.\\r\\nFranklin said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"While Parliament claims the power of altering our constitution at\\r\\npleasure, there can be no agreement. We are rendered unsafe in every\\r\\nprivilege, and are secure in nothing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Barclay insolently replied, \"It would be well for the Americans to\\r\\ncome to an agreement with the court of Great Britain. They ought not\\r\\nto forget how easy a thing it will be for the British men-of-war to\\r\\nlay all their seaport towns in ashes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I grew warm,\" writes Franklin; \"said that the chief part of my\\r\\nlittle property consisted of houses in those towns; that they might\\r\\nmake bon-fires of them whenever they pleased; that the fear of losing\\r\\nthem would never alter my resolution to resist to the last, such\\r\\nclaims of Parliament; and that it behoved this country to take care\\r\\nwhat mischief it did us; for that sooner or later it would certainly\\r\\nbe obliged to make good all damages, with interest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStill again these corrupt men, who are selling themselves and buying\\r\\nothers, approached Franklin with attempts to bribe him. \"They could\\r\\nnot comprehend that any man could be above the reach of such\\r\\ninfluences. It was contemplated sending Lord Howe to America as a\\r\\nCommissioner. He applied to Franklin to go with him as friend,\\r\\nassistant or secretary.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Howe said to Franklin, that he could not think of undertaking\\r\\nthe mission without him; that if he effected any thing valuable, it\\r\\nmust be owing to the advice Franklin would afford him; and that he\\r\\nshould make no scruple of giving him the full honor of it. He assured\\r\\nhim that the ministry did not expect his assistance without a\\r\\nproper consideration; that they wished to make generous and ample\\r\\nappointments for those who aided them, and also would give them the\\r\\npromise of subsequent more ample rewards.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And,\" said he, with marked emphasis, \"that the ministry may have an\\r\\nopportunity of showing their good disposition toward yourself, will\\r\\nyou give me leave, Mr. Franklin, to procure for you, previously, some\\r\\nmark of it; suppose the payment here, of the arrears of your salary as\\r\\nagent for New England, which, I understand, they have stopped for some\\r\\ntime past.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will be remembered that Lord Howe was sincerely the friend of\\r\\nAmerica, and that he anxiously desired to see friendly relations\\r\\nrestored. Franklin therefore restrained his displeasure, and\\r\\ncourteously replied,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My Lord, I shall deem it a great honor to be, in any shape, joined\\r\\nwith your lordship in so good a work. But if you hope service from any\\r\\ninfluence I may be supposed to have, drop all thoughts of procuring me\\r\\nany previous favors from ministers. My accepting them would destroy\\r\\nthe very influence you propose to make use of. They would be\\r\\nconsidered as so many bribes to betray the interests of my country.\\r\\nOnly let me see the propositions and I shall not hesitate for a\\r\\nmoment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRepeated interviews ensued, between Franklin and both the friends and\\r\\nthe enemies of the Americans. There were interminable conferences. But\\r\\nthe court was implacable in its resolve, to maintain a supreme and\\r\\nexclusive control over the colonies. Every hour of Franklin\\'s time was\\r\\nengrossed. Merchants and manufacturers, Tories and the opposition,\\r\\nlords temporal, and lords spiritual, all called upon him with their\\r\\nseveral plans. There were many Americans in London, including a large\\r\\nnumber of Quakers. These crowded the apartment of Franklin. The\\r\\nnegotiations were terminated by a debate in the House of Lords, in\\r\\nwhich the Americans were assailed in the vilest language of insult and\\r\\nabuse which can be coined. Franklin was present. He writes,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"We were treated with the utmost contempt, as the lowest of\\r\\n     mankind, and almost of a different species from the English\\r\\n     of Britain. Particularly American honesty was abused by some\\r\\n     of the lords, who asserted that we were all knaves, and\\r\\n     wanted only, by this dispute, to avoid paying our debts.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin returned to his home, with feelings of indignation, which\\r\\nhis calm spirit had rarely before experienced. He resolved no longer\\r\\nto have any thing to do with the hostile governing powers of England.\\r\\nHe had loved the British empire. He felt proud of its renown, and that\\r\\nAmerica was but part and parcel of its greatness. But there was no\\r\\nlonger hope, that there could be any escape from the awful appeal to\\r\\narms. Though that measure would be fraught with inconceivable woes for\\r\\nhis countrymen, he was assured that they would never submit. They\\r\\nwould now march to independence though the path led through scenes of\\r\\nconflagration, blood and unutterable woe. His experience placed him in\\r\\nadvance of all his countrymen.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin immediately commenced packing his trunks. Astonishing, almost\\r\\nincredible as it may appear, the evidence seems conclusive that\\r\\nthrough all these trying scenes, Franklin was a cheerful, it is hardly\\r\\ntoo strong a word to use, a _jovial_ man. It has been well said, that\\r\\nto be angry is to punish one\\'s self for the sins of another. Our\\r\\nphilosopher had no idea of making himself unhappy, because British\\r\\nlords behaved like knaves. He continued to be one of the most\\r\\nentertaining of companions. A cloudless sun seemed to shine wherever\\r\\nhe moved. He made witty speeches. He wrote the most amusing articles\\r\\nfor the journals, and the invariable gayety of his mind caused his\\r\\nsociety to be eagerly sought for.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening he attended quite a brilliant party at a nobleman\\'s house,\\r\\nwho was a friend to America. The conversation chanced to turn upon\\r\\nEsop\\'s fables. It was said that that mine of illustration was\\r\\nexhausted. Franklin, after a moment\\'s thought, remarked, that many new\\r\\nfables could be invented, as instructive as any of those of Esop, Gay,\\r\\nor La Fontaine. Can you think of one now, asked a lord. \"I think so,\"\\r\\nsaid Franklin, \"if you will furnish me with pencil and paper.\" He\\r\\nimmediately sat down, surrounded by the gay assembly, and wrote, as\\r\\nrapidly as his pencil could move,\\r\\n\\r\\n               \"THE EAGLE AND THE CAT.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Once upon a time an eagle, scaling round a farmer\\'s barn,\\r\\n     and espying a hare, darted down upon him like a sunbeam,\\r\\n     seized him in his claws, and remounted with him into the\\r\\n     air. He soon found that he had a creature of more courage\\r\\n     and strength than the hare; for which he had mistaken a cat.\\r\\n     The snarling and scrambling of his prey were very\\r\\n     inconvenient. And what was worse, she had disengaged herself\\r\\n     from his talons, grasped his body with her four limbs, so as\\r\\n     to stop his breath, and seized fast hold of his throat, with\\r\\n     her teeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"\\'Pray,\\' said the eagle, \\'let go your hold, and I will\\r\\n     release you.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"\\'Very fine,\\' said the cat. \\'But I have no fancy to fall\\r\\n     from this height, and to be crushed to death. You have taken\\r\\n     me up, and you shall stoop and let me down.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The eagle thought it necessary to stoop accordingly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis admirable fable was read to the company; and, as all were in\\r\\nsympathy with America, it was received with great applause. Little,\\r\\nhowever, did any of them then imagine, how invincible was the animal\\r\\nthe British government was about to clutch in its talons, supposing it\\r\\nto be a defenseless hare.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin spent his last day in London with Dr. Priestly. The Doctor\\r\\nbears glowing testimony to his admirable character. Many thought Dr.\\r\\nFranklin heartless, since, in view of all the horrors of a civil war,\\r\\nhis hilarity was never interrupted. Priestly, alluding to this charge\\r\\nagainst Franklin, says, that they spent the day looking over the\\r\\nAmerican papers, and extracting from them passages to be published in\\r\\nEngland. \"In reading them,\" he writes, \"Franklin was frequently not\\r\\nable to proceed for the tears literally running down his cheeks.\" Upon\\r\\nhis departure, he surrendered his agency to Arthur Lee. It was the\\r\\n21st of March, 1775, when Franklin embarked at Portsmouth, in a\\r\\nPennsylvania packet.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin was apprehensive until the last moment, that he would not be\\r\\npermitted to depart; that the court, which had repeatedly denounced\\r\\nhim as a traitor, would arrest him on some frivolous charge. On the\\r\\nvoyage he wrote a minute narrative of his diplomatic career, occupying\\r\\ntwo hundred and fifty pages of foolscap. This important document was\\r\\ngiven to his son William Franklin, who was daily becoming a more\\r\\ninveterate Tory, endeavoring to ingratiate himself into favor with the\\r\\ncourt, from which he had received the appointment of governor.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin also sent a copy to Mr. Jefferson, perhaps apprehensive that\\r\\nhis son might not deal fairly with a document which so terribly\\r\\ncondemned the British government. The Governor subsequently published\\r\\nthe narrative. But there is reason to suppose that he suppressed those\\r\\npassages, which revealed most clearly the atrocious conduct of the\\r\\nBritish cabinet. Jefferson wrote some years later, alluding to this\\r\\ndocument:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I remember that Lord North\\'s answers were dry, unyielding,\\r\\n     in the spirit of unconditional submission, and betrayed an\\r\\n     absolute indifference to the occurrence of a rupture. And he\\r\\n     said to the mediators distinctly, at last, that _a rebellion\\r\\n     was not to be deprecated on the part of Great Britain; that\\r\\n     the confiscations it would produce, would provide for many\\r\\n     of their friends_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea that the feeble Americans, scattered along a coast more than\\r\\na thousand miles in extent, without a fortress, a vessel of war, or a\\r\\nregiment of regular troops, could withstand the fleets and armies of\\r\\nGreat Britain, was never entertained for a moment. Indeed, as we now\\r\\ncontemplate the fearful odds, it causes one\\'s heart to throb, and we\\r\\ncannot but be amazed at the courage which our patriotic fathers\\r\\ndisplayed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a common boast in England, that one regiment of British\\r\\nregulars could march from Boston to Charleston, and sweep all\\r\\nopposition before them. A band of ten wolves can put a flock of ten\\r\\nthousand sheep to flight. It was quite a pleasant thought, to the\\r\\nhaughty court, that one or two ships of war, and two or three\\r\\nregiments could be sent across the Atlantic, seize and hang\\r\\nWashington, Franklin, Adams, Jefferson, and others of our leading\\r\\npatriots, and confiscate the property of hundreds of others, for the\\r\\nenrichment of the favorites of the crown.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There will be no fighting;\" these deluded men said, \"it will be a\\r\\nmere holiday excursion. The turbulent and foolhardy Americans will be\\r\\nbrought to their senses, and, like whipped spaniels, will fawn upon\\r\\nthe hand which has chastised them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe voyage across the Atlantic occupied six weeks. In the evening\\r\\ntwilight of the 5th of May, the ship dropped anchor in the Delaware,\\r\\nopposite Philadelphia. Franklin landed, and walked alone through the\\r\\ndarkened streets towards his home. It is difficult to imagine the\\r\\nemotions with which his heart must have been agitated in that hour.\\r\\nTen years had elapsed since he left his home. In the meantime his wife\\r\\nhad reared another dwelling, in Market street, and there she had died.\\r\\nHe had left his daughter Sarah, a child of twelve years. He was to\\r\\nfind her a matron surrounded by her babes.\\r\\n\\r\\nCordially Franklin was welcomed home. The whole country resounded\\r\\nwith the praises he so richly merited. The morning after his arrival\\r\\nhe was unanimously chosen by the Assembly, then in session, as a\\r\\nmember of the Continental Congress, which was to meet on the 10th\\r\\nof the month, in that city. Sixteen days before Franklin\\'s arrival\\r\\nthe memorable conflicts of Lexington and Concord had taken place.\\r\\nProbably never were men more astounded, than were the members of\\r\\nthe British cabinet, in learning that the British regulars had been\\r\\ndefeated, routed and put to precipitate flight by American farmers\\r\\nwith their fowling-pieces. In this heroic conflict, whose echoes\\r\\nreverberated around the world, the Americans lost in killed and\\r\\nwounded eighty-three. The British lost two hundred and seventy-three.\\r\\nFranklin wrote to his friend Edmund Burke,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Gen. Gage\\'s troops made a most vigorous retreat--twenty\\r\\n     miles in three hours--scarce to be paralleled in history.\\r\\n     The feeble Americans, who pelted them all the way, could\\r\\n     scarce keep up with them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 10th of May Congress met. There were still two parties, one in\\r\\nfavor of renewed attempts at conciliation, before drawing the sword\\r\\nand throwing away the scabbard; the other felt that the powers of\\r\\nconciliation were exhausted, and that nothing now remained, but the\\r\\narbitrament of war.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorge Washington was chosen, by the Assembly, Commander-in-Chief of\\r\\nthe American forces. On the 17th of June the battle of Bunker Hill was\\r\\nfought. Mr. John Dickinson trembled in view of his great wealth. His\\r\\nwife entreated him to withdraw from the conflict. Piteously she urged\\r\\nthe considerations, that he would be hung, his wife left a widow, and\\r\\nhis children beggared and rendered infamous. He succeeded in passing a\\r\\nresolution in favor of a second petition to the king, which he drew\\r\\nup, and which the Tory Governor Richard Penn was to present. John\\r\\nAdams, who was weary of having his country continue in the attitude of\\r\\na suppliant kneeling at the foot of the throne, opposed this petition,\\r\\nas a \"measure of imbecility.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the first acts of Congress was to organize a system for the\\r\\nsafe conveyance of letters, which could no longer be trusted in the\\r\\nhands of the agents of the British Court. Franklin was appointed\\r\\nPostmaster General. He had attained the age of sixty nine years.\\r\\nNotwithstanding his gravity of character and his great wisdom, he had\\r\\nunfortunately become an inveterate joker. He could not refrain from\\r\\ninserting, even in his most serious and earnest documents, some\\r\\nwitticism, which men of the intensity of soul of John Adams and Thomas\\r\\nJefferson, felt to be out of place. Still the wisdom of his counsels\\r\\ninvariably commanded respect. Upon learning of the burning of\\r\\nCharleston, he wrote to Dr. Priestly,[25]\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"England has begun to burn our seaport towns, secure, I\\r\\n     suppose, that we shall never be able to return the outrage\\r\\n     in kind. She may, doubtless, destroy them all. But if she\\r\\n     wishes to recover our commerce, are these the probable\\r\\n     means? She must certainly be distracted; for no tradesman,\\r\\n     out of Bedlam, ever thought of increasing the number of his\\r\\n     customers by knocking them in the head; or of enabling them\\r\\n     to pay their debts by burning their houses.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 25: \"And here perhaps we have one of the reasons why Dr.\\r\\nFranklin, who was universally confessed to be the ablest pen in\\r\\nAmerica, was not always asked to write the great documents of the\\r\\nRevolution. He would have put a joke into the Declaration of\\r\\nIndependence, if it had fallen to him to write it. At this time he was\\r\\na humorist of fifty years standing, and had become fixed in the habit\\r\\nof illustrating great truths by grotesque and familiar similes. His\\r\\njokes, the circulating medium of Congress, were as helpful to the\\r\\ncause, as Jay\\'s conscience or Adams\\' fire; they restored good humor,\\r\\nand relieved the tedium of delay, but were out of place in formal,\\r\\nexact and authoritative papers.\"--_Parton\\'s Franklin_, Vol. 2. p. 85.]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of Franklin\\'s jokes, in Congress, is very characteristic of the\\r\\nman. It was urged that the Episcopal clergy should be directed to\\r\\nrefrain from praying for the king. Franklin quenched the injudicious\\r\\nmovement with a witticism.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The measure is quite unnecessary,\" said he. \"The Episcopal clergy, to\\r\\nmy certain knowledge, have been constantly praying, these twenty\\r\\nyears, that \\'God would give to the king and council wisdom.\\' And we\\r\\nall know that not the least notice has been taken of that prayer. So\\r\\nit\\'s plain that those gentlemen have no interest in the court of\\r\\nHeaven.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we sow the wind we must reap the whirlwind. Terrible was the\\r\\nmortification and mental suffering which Franklin endured from the\\r\\ngovernor of New Jersey. He had lived down the prejudices connected\\r\\nwith his birth and had become an influential and popular man. He,\\r\\nwith increasing tenacity adhered to the British Government, and became\\r\\neven the malignant opponent of the Americans. He pronounced the idea\\r\\nof their successfully resisting the power of Great Britain, as utterly\\r\\nabsurd. His measures became so atrocious, as to excite the indignation\\r\\nof the people of New Jersey. The Assembly finally arrested him and\\r\\nsent him, under guard, to Burlington. As he continued contumacious and\\r\\nmenacing, Congress ordered him to be removed to Connecticut. The\\r\\nConstitutional Gazette of July 13th, 1776, contains the following\\r\\nallusion to this affair:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Day before yesterday Governor Franklin, of New Jersey,\\r\\n     passed through Hartford, on his way to Governor Trumbull.\\r\\n     Mr. Franklin is a noted Tory and ministerial tool, and has\\r\\n     been exceedingly busy in perplexing the cause of liberty,\\r\\n     and in serving the designs of the British king and his\\r\\n     ministers.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"He is son to Dr. Benjamin Franklin, the genius of the day,\\r\\n     and the great patron of American liberty. If his excellency\\r\\n     escapes the vengeance of the people, due to the enormity of\\r\\n     his crimes, his redemption will flow, not from his personal\\r\\n     merit, but from the high esteem and veneration which the\\r\\n     country entertains for his honored father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis family was left in deep affliction. Franklin sent them both\\r\\nsympathy and money. The captive governor resided at Middletown on\\r\\nparole. Here the infatuated man gathered around him a band of Tories,\\r\\nmany of whom were rich, and held convivial meetings exceedingly\\r\\nexasperating, when British armies were threatening the people with\\r\\nconflagration and carnage.\\r\\n\\r\\nInflamed with wine, these bacchanals sang treasonable songs, the whole\\r\\ncompany joining in chorus, with uproar which drew large groups around\\r\\nthe house. The Tories professed utterly to despise the patriots, and\\r\\ndoubted not that their leaders would all soon be hung. One midnight\\r\\nthe governor, with his boon companions, having indulged in the wildest\\r\\nof their orgies, sallied into the streets, with such uproar as to make\\r\\nnight hideous. The watch found it needful to interfere. The drunken\\r\\ngovernor called one of them a damned villain and threatened to flog\\r\\nhim. A report of these proceedings was sent to Congress.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after it was ascertained that he was an active agent for the\\r\\nBritish ministry. He was then confined in Litchfield jail, and\\r\\ndeprived of pen, ink and paper. For two years he suffered this\\r\\nwell-merited imprisonment. Mrs. governor Franklin never saw her\\r\\nhusband again. Grief-stricken, she fell sick, and died in New York in\\r\\nJuly, 1778.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter an imprisonment of two years and four months, William Franklin\\r\\nwas exchanged, and he took refuge within the British lines at New\\r\\nYork. He received a pension from the British government, lived\\r\\nhilariously, and devoted his energies to a vigorous prosecution of the\\r\\nwar against his countrymen. Franklin felt deeply this defection of his\\r\\nson. After the lapse of nine years he wrote,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Nothing has ever affected me with such keen sensations, as\\r\\n     to find myself deserted in my old age by my only son; and\\r\\n     not only deserted but to find him taking up arms in a cause\\r\\n     wherein my good fame, fortune and life were at stake.\"[26]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 26: Upon the overthrow of the royalist cause, Governor\\r\\nFranklin with other Tories went to England. Government gave him\\r\\noutright eighteen hundred pounds, and settled upon him a pension of\\r\\neight hundred pounds a year. After the lapse of ten years he sought\\r\\nreconciliation with his father. He lived to the age of eighty-two and\\r\\ndied in London, in 1813.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIII.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Progress of the War, both of Diplomacy and the Sword._\\r\\n\\r\\n     Letter of Henry Laurens--Franklin visits the army before\\r\\n     Boston--Letter of Mrs. Adams--Burning of\\r\\n     Falmouth--Franklin\\'s journey to Montreal--The Declaration of\\r\\n     Independence--Anecdote of the Hatter--Framing the\\r\\n     Constitution--Lord Howe\\'s Declaration--Franklin\\'s reply--The\\r\\n     Conference--Encouraging letter from France--Franklin\\'s\\r\\n     embassy to France--The two parties in France--The\\r\\n     voyage--The reception in France.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spirit which, almost to that hour, had animated the people of\\r\\nAmerica,--the most illustrious statesmen and common people, was\\r\\nattachment to Old England. Their intense desire to maintain friendly\\r\\nrelations with the mother country, their \"home,\" their revered and\\r\\nbeloved home, may be inferred from the following extract from a\\r\\nletter, which one of the noblest of South Carolinians, Hon. Henry\\r\\nLaurens, wrote to his son John. It bears the date of 1776. He writes,\\r\\nalluding to the separation from England, then beginning to be\\r\\ncontemplated:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I can not rejoice in the downfall of an old friend, of a\\r\\n     parent from whose nurturing breasts I have drawn my support\\r\\n     and strength. Every evil which befalls old England grieves\\r\\n     me. Would to God she had listened, in time, to the cries of\\r\\n     her children. If my own interests, if my own rights alone\\r\\n     had been concerned, I would most freely have given the whole\\r\\n     to the demands and disposal of her ministers, in preference\\r\\n     to a separation. But the rights of posterity were involved\\r\\n     in the question. I happened to stand as one of their\\r\\n     representatives, and dared not betray their trust.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWashington, Adams, Jay, would have made almost any conceivable\\r\\nsacrifice of their personal interest, if they could have averted the\\r\\ncalamity of a separation from the home of their ancestors. But the\\r\\nconduct of the British Cabinet was not only despotic, in the highest\\r\\ndegree, but it was insolent and contemptuous beyond all endurance. It\\r\\nseemed to be generally assumed that a man, if born on the majestic\\r\\ncontinent of North America, instead of being born on their little\\r\\nisland, must be an inferior being. They regarded Americans as\\r\\nslave-holders were accustomed to regard the negro. Almost every\\r\\ninterview resolved itself into an insult. Courteous intercourse was\\r\\nimpossible. Affection gave place to detestation.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 13th of September, 1775, Congress assembled in Philadelphia.\\r\\nLexington, Bunker Hill, and other hostile acts of our implacable foes,\\r\\nhad thrown the whole country into the most intense agitation. Military\\r\\ncompanies were every where being organized. Musket manufactories and\\r\\npowder mills were reared. Ladies were busy scraping lint, and\\r\\npreparing bandages. And what was the cause of all this commotion,\\r\\nwhich converted America, for seven years, into an Aceldama of blood\\r\\nand woe?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was that haughty, insolent men in England, claimed the right to\\r\\nimpose taxes, to whatever amount they pleased, upon their brother men\\r\\nin America. They did not blush to say, \"It is the prerogative of us\\r\\nEnglishmen to demand of you Americans such sums of money as we want.\\r\\nUnless, like obsequious slaves, you pay the money, without murmuring,\\r\\nwe will burn your cities and deluge your whole land in blood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWashington was assembling quite an army of American troops around\\r\\nBoston, holding the foe in close siege there. Franklin was sent, by\\r\\nCongress, as one of a committee of three, to confer with Washington\\r\\nupon raising and supplying the American army. Amidst all these\\r\\nterrific excitements and perils this wonderful man could not refrain\\r\\nfrom giving expression to his sense of the ludicrous. The day before\\r\\nleaving Philadelphia, he wrote to Dr. Priestly the following humorous\\r\\nsummary of the result of the British operations thus far.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Britain at the expense of three millions, has killed one\\r\\n     hundred and fifty Yankees this campaign, which is twenty\\r\\n     thousand pounds a head. And, at Bunker Hill, she gained a\\r\\n     mile of ground, half of which she lost again by our taking\\r\\n     post on Ploughed Hill. During the same time sixty thousand\\r\\n     children have been born in America. From these data, Dr.\\r\\n     Price\\'s mathematical head will easily calculate the time and\\r\\n     expense necessary to kill us all, and conquer our whole\\r\\n     territory.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt required a journey of thirteen days, for the Commissioners to pass\\r\\nfrom Philadelphia to Cambridge. On the 4th of October they reached the\\r\\ncamp. Mrs. John Adams, who was equal to her husband in patriotism, in\\r\\nintellectual ability and in self-denial, writes,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I had the pleasure of dining with Dr. Franklin, and of\\r\\n     admiring him whose character, from infancy, I had been\\r\\n     taught to venerate. I found him social, but not talkative;\\r\\n     and when he spoke, something useful dropped from his tongue.\\r\\n     He was grave, yet pleasant and affable. You know I make some\\r\\n     pretensions to physiognomy, and I thought that I could read\\r\\n     in his countenance, the virtues of his heart; and with that\\r\\n     is blended every virtue of a Christian.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conference lasted four days, and resulted in the adoption of very\\r\\nimportant measures. While in the camp, news came of the burning of\\r\\nPortland, then Falmouth. It was a deed which would have disgraced\\r\\nAmerican savages. The town was entirely defenceless. It held out no\\r\\nmenace whatever to the foe. The cold blasts of a Maine winter were at\\r\\nhand. A British man-of-war entered the harbor, and giving but a few\\r\\nhours notice, that the sick and the dying might be removed, and that\\r\\nthe women and children might escape from shot and shell, to the frozen\\r\\nfields, one hundred and thirty humble, peaceful homes were laid in\\r\\nashes. The cruel flames consumed nearly all their household furniture,\\r\\ntheir clothing and the frugal food they had laid in store for their\\r\\nlong and dreary winter. A few houses escaped the shells. Marines were\\r\\nlanded to apply the torch to them, that the destruction might be\\r\\ncomplete.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were several vessels in the harbor. The freezing, starving,\\r\\nhomeless wives and daughters who had not strength to toil through the\\r\\nwilderness to seek distant cabins of refuge, might perhaps escape in\\r\\nthem. To prevent this they were burned to the water\\'s edge. It was an\\r\\ninfernal deed. It struck to the very heart of America. Even now, after\\r\\na lapse of one hundred years, no American can read an account of this\\r\\noutrage without the flushed cheek and the moistened eye which\\r\\nindignation creates. Mrs. Adams wrote,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I could not join to-day in the petitions of our worthy\\r\\n     pastor for a reconciliation between our no longer parent,\\r\\n     but tyrant state, and these colonies. Let us separate. They\\r\\n     are no longer worthy to be our brethren. Let us renounce\\r\\n     them, and instead of supplications, as formerly for their\\r\\n     prosperity and happiness, let us beseech the Almighty to\\r\\n     blast their councils and bring to naught all their devices.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Franklin was the sweetest tempered of men, he returned to\\r\\nPhiladelphia with his spirit greatly embittered against the demoniac\\r\\nfoes of his country. For some time no jokes escaped his lips or pen.\\r\\nIn December, Arnold, then a patriot and a brave soldier, had made an\\r\\nunsuccessful attack upon Quebec. He had retired to Montreal. Franklin\\r\\nwas again appointed one of these commissioners, to visit Arnold and\\r\\nadvise respecting Canadian affairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the Canadians were Catholics. One of the commissioners was\\r\\nCharles Carroll of Carollton. He had a brother John, a Catholic\\r\\npriest, a man of high culture, of irreproachable character and a\\r\\nsincere patriot. He was perfectly familiar with the French language.\\r\\nBy the solicitation of Congress he was induced to accompany his\\r\\nbrother on this mission. It was hoped that he would be able to exert\\r\\na powerful influence over the Canadian clergy. Franklin and John\\r\\nCarroll became intimate and loving friends. It speaks well for both,\\r\\nthat the free-thinking philosopher, and the Catholic priest could so\\r\\nrecognize each other\\'s virtues, as to forget their speculative\\r\\ndifferences in mutual regard.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was before the commissioners, a very laborious journey of five\\r\\nhundred miles, much of it leading through an almost unexplored\\r\\nwilderness. It shows great zeal in Franklin, that at the age of\\r\\nseventy, he was willing to encounter such exposure.\\r\\n\\r\\nLate in March, the commissioners left Philadelphia. In two days they\\r\\nreached New York. They found the place deserted of its inhabitants. It\\r\\nwas held but by a few soldiers, as it was hourly expected that the\\r\\nBritish, from their fleet and batteries, would open upon it a terrific\\r\\nbombardment. How little can we imagine the sufferings which must\\r\\nensue, when thousands of families are driven, in terror, from their\\r\\nhomes, from all their means of support, to go they know not where, and\\r\\nto live they know not how.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few sad days were passed in the ruined town, and on the 2d of April\\r\\nthe party embarked, at five in the afternoon, in a packet for Albany.\\r\\nAt seven o\\'clock in the morning of the 4th day, after an eventful\\r\\nvoyage, in which they narrowly escaped shipwreck from a gale in the\\r\\nHighlands, they landed at Albany, where they were hospitably\\r\\nentertained by General Schuyler.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a brief rest, on the 9th, they set out for Saratoga, which was\\r\\ndistant about thirty-two miles. They were conveyed over an exceedingly\\r\\nrough road of rocks, and corduroy and mire, in a large, heavy, country\\r\\nwagon. From this place, Franklin wrote,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I begin to apprehend that I have undertaken a fatigue\\r\\n     which, at my time of life, may prove too much for me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a short tarry at the country seat of General Sullivan at\\r\\nSaratoga, the party moved on toward Lake George. In those northern\\r\\nlatitudes the ground was still covered with snow, and the lake was\\r\\nfilled with floating ice. Two days of very exhausting travel brought\\r\\nthem to the southern shore of the beautiful but then dreary lake. Here\\r\\nthey took a large boat, thirty-six feet long, and eight broad. It was\\r\\nwhat was called a bateau, which was flat-bottomed, and was but one\\r\\nfoot in depth. There was one mast, and a blanket sail, which was\\r\\navailable when the wind was directly aft. There was no cabin. A mere\\r\\nawning sheltered partially from wind and rain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus they crept across the lake, through masses of ice, a distance of\\r\\nthirty-six miles, in thirty-six hours. There was a neck of land, four\\r\\nmiles in breadth, which separated Lake George from Lake Champlain. The\\r\\nheavy boat, placed on wheels, was dragged across by six yoke of oxen.\\r\\nA delay of five days was thus caused, before they were ready to embark\\r\\non the latter lake. The navigation of this small sheet of water,\\r\\nsurrounded by the primeval forest, and with scarcely the cabin of a\\r\\nwhite man to be seen, must have been romantic indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey sailed when the wind favored, and rowed when it was adverse. At\\r\\nnight they ran ashore, built their camp fire, which illumined lake and\\r\\nforest, boiled their coffee, cooked their viands, and, some under the\\r\\nawning, and some under the shelter of a hastily constructed camp,\\r\\nslept sweetly. The ice greatly impeded their progress. In three and a\\r\\nhalf days, they reached St. John\\'s, near the upper end of the lake.\\r\\nThe toilsome journey of another day, brought them to Montreal. None of\\r\\nthe commissioners were accustomed to thus roughing it. All were\\r\\ngreatly exhausted.\\r\\n\\r\\nA council of war was convened. Canada was clearly lost to the\\r\\nAmericans. It was at once decided that nothing remained but to\\r\\nwithdraw the troops. Early in June, Franklin reached Philadelphia,\\r\\nfrom his toilsome journey. He had been absent about ten weeks. The\\r\\ndoom of the proprietary government over Pennsylvania, was now sealed.\\r\\nCongress had voted that all authority derived from the king of\\r\\nEngland, was extinct. A conference of delegates was appointed to\\r\\norganize a new government for the province. Franklin was, of course,\\r\\none of these delegates. A committee had been appointed, by Congress,\\r\\nto draw up a Declaration of Independence. The committee consisted of\\r\\nJefferson, Franklin, Adams, Livingston, and Sherman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe immortal document, as all the world knows, came from the pen of\\r\\nJefferson. It was offered to Congress for acceptance. Many frivolous\\r\\nobjections were, of course, presented. One man thought this phrase a\\r\\nlittle too severe. Another thought that a little too lenient. Franklin\\r\\nsat by the side of Jefferson, as the admirable document was subjected\\r\\nto this assailment. Turning to him he said, in one of the most\\r\\ncharacteristic and popular of all his utterances,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I was a journeyman printer, one of my companions, an apprenticed\\r\\nhatter, was about to open a shop for himself. His first concern was to\\r\\nhave a handsome sign-board, with a proper inscription. He composed it\\r\\nin these words,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"John Thompson, Hatter, makes and sells Hats for ready Money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he thought he would submit it to his friends for their amendments.\\r\\nThe first he showed it to, thought the word _hatter_ tautologous;\\r\\nbecause followed by the words _makes hats_, which showed that he was a\\r\\nhatter. It was struck out. The next observed that the word _makes_,\\r\\nmight as well be omitted, because his customers would not care who\\r\\nmade the hats; if good, and to their mind, they would buy, by\\r\\nwhomsoever made. He struck it out. A third said he thought the words,\\r\\nfor _ready money_, were useless; as it was not the custom of the place\\r\\nto sell on credit. Every one who purchased, expected to pay. They were\\r\\nparted with. The inscription now stood,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"John Thompson sells hats.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Sells_ hats,\" says his next friend. \"Why nobody will expect you to\\r\\ngive them away. What then is the use of that word?\" It was stricken\\r\\nout, and _hats_ followed, the rather as there was one painted on the\\r\\nboard. So his inscription was reduced ultimately to _John Thompson_,\\r\\nwith the figure of a hat subjoined.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will be remembered the readiness with which Dr. Franklin, on the\\r\\nspur of the moment, threw off the admirable fable of the Eagle and the\\r\\nHare. It is altogether probable that, in the inexhaustible resources\\r\\nof his genius, he improvised this anecdote to meet the exigencies of\\r\\nthe occasion.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Hessian troops, whom England had hired of a German prince,\\r\\narrived, intelligent men in this country pitied rather than blamed\\r\\nthose simple hearted peasants, who had no animosity whatever, against\\r\\nthe Americans. They had been compelled, by their feudal lord, who was\\r\\nreally their slave master, to leave their lowly homes on the Rhine, to\\r\\nunite with English regulars and painted savages, in burning the homes\\r\\nand butchering the people struggling for existence in the wilderness\\r\\nof the New World.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain the all availing pen of Franklin was called into requisition. By\\r\\ndirection of Congress he drew up a friendly address to these\\r\\nunfortunate men, offering every German, who would abandon the\\r\\nignominious service to which his prince had sold him, a tract of rich\\r\\nland sufficient for an ample farm. The address was translated into\\r\\nGerman. Various were the devices adopted, to give the document\\r\\ncirculation in the Hessian camp. It doubtless exerted a powerful\\r\\ninfluence, in disarming these highly disciplined troops of all\\r\\nanimosity. The effect was perhaps seen in the spectacle witnessed a\\r\\nfew weeks afterwards, when nine hundred of these soldiers were led\\r\\nthrough the streets of Philadelphia, prisoners of war. It is not\\r\\nimprobable that many of them were more than willing to throw down\\r\\ntheir arms.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 20th of July, 1776, Franklin was chosen by the Convention,\\r\\none of nine delegates to represent Pennsylvania in the national\\r\\nCongress. One of the great difficulties to be surmounted, in a\\r\\nunion of the States, was to give the great States, like New York and\\r\\nPennsylvania, their own preponderance in the confederacy, while the\\r\\nminor states, like New Jersey and Delaware, should not be shorn of\\r\\ntheir influence. The difficulty was finally obviated by the present\\r\\nadmirable arrangement, by which each State, great or small, has two\\r\\nrepresentatives in the Senate, while their representation in the\\r\\nHouse depends upon the number of the population.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin excelled in the art of \"putting things.\" He silenced the\\r\\ndemand of the smaller States, to be, in all respects, on an equality\\r\\nwith the larger, by saying,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let the smaller colonies give equal money and men, and then have an\\r\\nequal vote. But if they have an equal vote, without bearing equal\\r\\nburdens, a confederation, upon such iniquitous principles, will never\\r\\nlast long.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe convention, to form a constitution for the State of Pennsylvania,\\r\\nmet at Philadelphia on the 16th of July, 1776. Franklin was\\r\\nunanimously chosen President. No pen can describe the intensity of his\\r\\nlabors. All appreciated his consummate wisdom, and yielded readily to\\r\\nhis suggestions. Troops were hurrying to and fro. One hundred and\\r\\ntwenty British war vessels were in New York harbor. No one knew upon\\r\\nwhat seaport the thunderbolts of this formidable armament would be\\r\\nhurled. The Americans had been defeated on Long Island in August,\\r\\n1776, and had almost miraculously escaped with their field pieces and\\r\\nstores, across the East River to New York. This brilliant retreat was\\r\\ndeemed, by the Americans, almost equivalent to a victory.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Howe, the old friend of Franklin and a humane and respected\\r\\nEnglishman, who was sincerely desirous of peace with the Colonies,\\r\\nwas appointed Admiral of the king\\'s naval forces. He accepted\\r\\nthe appointment, with the hope that, by the aid of Franklin,\\r\\nreconciliation might be effected. Still he was an Englishman and could\\r\\nnot conceive that Americans had any rights which the English\\r\\ngovernment was bound to respect. The degree of his infatuation may be\\r\\ninferred from the fact that, as soon as he reached our shores, he\\r\\npublished a Declaration, which he circulated far and wide, stating\\r\\nthat if the Americans would only give up the conflict and return to\\r\\nimplicit submission, the British Government would forgive their sins,\\r\\npardon the guilty ones, with a few exceptions, and receive them again\\r\\nto favor. The weak man seemed really to think, that this was an\\r\\nextraordinary act of clemency on the part of the English Court.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reply, which Franklin drew up, to the Declaration, was grand. And\\r\\nit was the more grand when we reflect that it was addressed to a man\\r\\nwho was supported by an army, of we know not how many thousand British\\r\\nregulars, and by a fleet of one hundred and twenty war vessels, many\\r\\nof which were of gigantic armament. Admiral Howe had written a\\r\\ncourteous private letter to Dr. Franklin, in which he enclosed the\\r\\nDeclaration. Congress gave Franklin permission to reply. He wrote,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"My lord; the official despatches to which you refer me,\\r\\n     contain nothing more than offers of pardon upon submission.\\r\\n     Directing pardon to be offered to the colonies, who are the\\r\\n     very parties injured, expresses indeed that opinion of our\\r\\n     ignorance, baseness, and insensibility which your uninformed\\r\\n     and proud nation has long been pleased to entertain of us.\\r\\n     It is impossible that we should think of submission to a\\r\\n     government that has, with the most wanton barbarity and\\r\\n     cruelty, burnt our defenseless towns, in the midst of\\r\\n     winter, excited the savages to massacre our farmers, and\\r\\n     our slaves to murder their masters, and is, even now,\\r\\n     bringing foreign mercenaries to deluge our settlements with\\r\\n     blood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI have not space to copy the remainder of this admirable letter. It\\r\\nwas delivered to Lord Howe, on board his flag ship in New York harbor,\\r\\nten days after its date. As he read it his countenance expressed\\r\\nsurprise, and almost his only remark was, \"My old friend has expressed\\r\\nhimself very warmly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA few weeks later this good natured but weak man paroled General\\r\\nSullivan, who was a prisoner of war, and sent him to Philadelphia,\\r\\nwith a message to Congress which Lord Howe cautiously declined to put\\r\\nupon paper. General Sullivan reduced the message to writing and\\r\\npresented it to Congress. It was in substance as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The government of England cannot admit that Congress is a legitimate\\r\\nbody, to be recognized by any diplomatic relations whatever. It is but\\r\\na tumultous assembly of men who have treasonably conspired against\\r\\ntheir lawful sovereign. Still the government is willing that Lord Howe\\r\\nshould confer with some of the members of congress, as private\\r\\ngentlemen, to see if some terms of accommodation cannot be arranged.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter much and earnest discussion, in which a great diversity of\\r\\nopinion prevailed, it was voted that General Sullivan should inform\\r\\nAdmiral Howe, that a committee of three would be sent to ascertain\\r\\nwhether he \"has any authority to treat with persons, _authorized by\\r\\nCongress_ for that purpose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBenjamin Franklin, John Adams and Edward Rutledge composed this\\r\\ncommittee. An antique house, nearly a hundred years old, formerly the\\r\\nabode of wealth and splendor, which stood in a green lawn, but a few\\r\\nrods from the beach on the western shore of Staten Island, was chosen\\r\\nas the place for the conference. A two days\\' journey conveyed the\\r\\ncommittee to Amboy, opposite the house. Adams traveled on horseback:\\r\\nFranklin and Rutledge in a two wheel chaise.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmiral Howe sent a boat, under the protection of a flag of truce,\\r\\nwith an officer, who stated that he was to be left behind as a hostage\\r\\nfor their safe return. Promptly they declined manifesting any such\\r\\ndistrust of the honor of Admiral Howe, and took the hostage back in\\r\\nthe boat with them. The barge, propelled by lusty rowers, soon reached\\r\\nthe Staten Island shore. A large apartment of the old stone house had\\r\\nbeen richly decorated with moss and branches in honor of the occasion.\\r\\n\\r\\nA regiment of Hessians was posted at that spot. The colonel drew them\\r\\nup in two lines and through this lane of soldiers the commissioners\\r\\nadvanced from the beach to the house. When Admiral Howe saw that the\\r\\nofficer he had sent as a hostage had been returned, he said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gentlemen, you pay me a high compliment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCordially the kind-hearted admiral received his guests, and invited\\r\\nthem to an ample collation of cold ham, tongues, mutton and wine. Mr.\\r\\nHenry Strachey, secretary of Lord Howe, wrote a very full report of\\r\\nthe interview, which accords entirely with the narrative which John\\r\\nAdams presented to Congress. In as sincere and friendly words as human\\r\\nlips could pronounce, the Admiral assured the American gentlemen of\\r\\nhis earnest desire to promote reconciliation between the colonists and\\r\\nthe mother country. He alluded to the fact that in England he had been\\r\\nregarded as the friend of America, and to the honor Massachusetts had\\r\\nconferred upon his family by rearing a monument to his brother, who\\r\\nhad fallen at Ticonderoga. Franklin well knew that Howe was regarded\\r\\nas the friend of America.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I assure you, gentlemen,\" said Lord Howe, \"that I esteem that honor\\r\\nto my family, above all things in this world. Such is my gratitude and\\r\\naffection to this country, on that account, that I feel for America as\\r\\nfor a brother. And if America should fall, I should feel and lament it\\r\\nlike the loss of a brother.\" The reply of Franklin to these sincere\\r\\nwords, seems a little discourteous. Assuming an air of great\\r\\nindifference and confidence, as though the fall of America was an idea\\r\\nnot to be thought of, he bowed, and with one of his blandest smiles\\r\\nsaid, \"I assure you, my lord, that we will do everything in our power\\r\\nto save your lordship from that mortification.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe admiral was feeling too deeply for jokes. He was wounded by the\\r\\nrebuke apparently contained in the reply of his old friend. But it\\r\\nmust not be forgotten that Franklin, the sweetest tempered of men, had\\r\\nnot yet recovered from the indignation caused by the barbarities\\r\\ninflicted by the British government upon the families of Falmouth.\\r\\nEvery day was bringing tidings of the atrocities which England,\\r\\nthrough its savage allies, was perpetrating on the frontiers, burning\\r\\nthe cabins of lonely farmers, and tomahawking and scalping women and\\r\\nchildren. And he was constrained to look upon Lord Howe as the agent\\r\\nof that government, commissioned to bear to the patriots of America\\r\\nonly the insulting messages, that the king and his ministers would\\r\\ngraciously pardon them the crime of attempting to resist their\\r\\ndespotism, if they would ask forgiveness, and in future submit\\r\\nuncomplainingly to the requirements of the crown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, while the kind-hearted admiral, with a bosom glowing with\\r\\nbrotherly sympathy, was acting upon the assumption that the Americans\\r\\nshould cherish undying emotions of gratitude to the king, that he was\\r\\nso ready to forgive their disobedience to his commands, Franklin and\\r\\nhis companions, found it difficult to restrain their emotions of\\r\\nindignation, in view of the truly diabolical course pursued by the\\r\\nBritish government. The court, in their judgment, merited the\\r\\nexecrations not only of Americans but of all humanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Howe very emphatically wished the commissioners to understand\\r\\nthat he met them merely as private individuals, and that he could not,\\r\\nin the slightest degree, recognize any authority in Congress. Franklin\\r\\ncoldly replied,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your lordship may consider us in any view you may think proper. We,\\r\\non our part, are at liberty to consider ourselves in our real\\r\\ncharacter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Adams replied with warmth, characteristic of his impetuous\\r\\nnature, \"Your lordship may consider _me_ in what light you please.\\r\\nIndeed I should be willing to consider myself, for a few moments, in\\r\\nany character which would be agreeable to your lordship, _except that\\r\\nof a British subject_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the conversation was continued, Franklin said, \"We have been\\r\\ndeputed, by Congress, simply to inquire of your lordship what\\r\\nproposition you have to offer _for the consideration of Congress_.\\r\\nBritish troops have ravaged our country and burnt our towns. We cannot\\r\\nagain be happy under the government of Great Britain. All former\\r\\nattachments are obliterated. America can never return to the\\r\\ndomination of Great Britain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Adams added, \"My lord, it is not in our power to treat otherwise\\r\\nthan as _independent states_. For my part, I avow my determination\\r\\nnever to depart from the idea of _independency_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Rutledge gave emphasis to these decisive words by saying, \"With\\r\\nregard to the people consenting to come again under the English\\r\\ngovernment, _it is impossible_. I can answer for South Carolina. The\\r\\nroyal government there was very oppressive. At last we took the\\r\\ngovernment into our own hands. The people are now settled, and happy,\\r\\nunder that government. They would not now return to the king\\'s\\r\\ngovernment even if Congress should desire it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the conference ended, by Lord Howe\\'s stating, that, as they\\r\\ninsisted upon _independence_, no accommodation was possible. Lord Howe\\r\\ncourteously accompanied the American gentlemen to the barge, and they\\r\\nwere rowed over to the New Jersey shore. In the report they made to\\r\\nCongress they stated, that the commission of Lord Howe only conferred\\r\\nupon him authority to grant pardon to the Americans, with a few\\r\\nexceptions, upon their entire submission to the king.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt required, in those days, a long time to cross the Atlantic. Seldom\\r\\ncould an answer be obtained to a letter in less than four or five\\r\\nmonths. To the usual delays and perils attached to the navigation of\\r\\nthat stormy sea, there was now to be added the danger of capture from\\r\\nthe swarm of British cruisers. Congress had several agents on the\\r\\ncontinent. But months passed away, during which no letters were\\r\\nreceived from them. This painful suspense was relieved, in September,\\r\\n1776, by a long letter to Dr. Franklin, from a French gentleman, Dr.\\r\\nDubourg. He was one of the prominent philosophers of Paris, and, by\\r\\nthe request of Count du Buffon, had translated into French, Franklin\\'s\\r\\ntreatise upon electricity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis letter was very cautiously written. It covered many sheets of\\r\\npaper. The all important substance of the letter was almost concealed\\r\\nfrom view by the mass of verbiage in which it was enveloped. But a\\r\\ncareful reading indicated that the French ministry and the nation were\\r\\nin sympathy with the Americans; that while the ministry wished to\\r\\navoid war with England they would gladly, if it could be done\\r\\nsecretly, send the Americans money and powder, cannon and muskets, and\\r\\nthat many French generals of note were eager to join the American\\r\\narmy, and confer upon it the benefit of their experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis news sent a thrill of joy through hearts which recent reverses\\r\\nhad rendered somewhat desponding. It was decided immediately to send\\r\\nan embassy of highest character to France. Three were to be chosen by\\r\\nballot. On the first ballot Dr. Franklin was unanimously elected. He\\r\\nwas seventy years old. And yet probably there was not another man in\\r\\nAmerica so well qualified to fill that difficult, delicate and\\r\\nresponsible post. Franklin, in the saloons of diplomacy, was fully the\\r\\npeer of Washington on the field of war. When the result of the ballot\\r\\nwas announced Franklin turned to Dr. Rush, who was at his side, and\\r\\nsaid,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am old and good for nothing. But as the store-keepers say of their\\r\\nremnants of cloth, \\'I am but a fag end, and you may have me for what\\r\\nyou please.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas Jefferson, then thirty-three years of age, and as pure a\\r\\npatriot as ever lived, was next chosen. He was already renowned in\\r\\nFrance as the writer of the Declaration of Independence. Silas Deane,\\r\\na native of Connecticut, and a graduate of Yale, then one of the\\r\\nagents in Europe, was the third.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt required no little courage to cross the ocean, swept by the fleets\\r\\nof Great Britain. Had Franklin or Jefferson fallen into the hands of\\r\\nthe British government, it is certain that they would have suffered\\r\\nsevere imprisonment; it is by no means improbable that they would have\\r\\nbeen promptly hung as traitors. It was a noble sacrifice for country\\r\\nwhich led Franklin, having numbered his three-score years and ten, to\\r\\nincur these perils.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 27: In the year 1780, Mr. Henry Laurens, formerly President\\r\\nof Congress, was sent as ambassador to Holland. The ship was captured\\r\\noff Newfoundland, after a chase of five hours. The unfortunate man was\\r\\nthrown into the Tower, where he was imprisoned fifteen months, \"where\"\\r\\nhe wrote to Mr. Burke, \"I suffered under a degree of rigor, almost if\\r\\nnot altogether unexampled in modern British history.\"]\\r\\n\\r\\nJefferson was compelled to decline the mission, as his wife, whom he\\r\\nloved with devotion rarely equalled, and perhaps never surpassed, was\\r\\nsick and dying. Arthur Lee, then in Europe, was elected in his stead.\\r\\nHe was a querulous, ill-natured man, ever in a broil. A more\\r\\nunsuitable man for the office could scarcely have been found.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were two parties in France who favored the Americans. One\\r\\nconsisted of enthusiastic young men, who were enamored with the idea\\r\\nof republican liberty. They were weary of Bourbon despotism. The\\r\\ncharacter of Louis XV., as vile a king as ever sat upon a throne, was\\r\\nloathsome to them. They had read Jefferson\\'s \"Declaration,\" with\\r\\ndelight; and had engraven its immortal principles upon their hearts.\\r\\nThe Marquis de Lafayette was perhaps the most prominent member of this\\r\\nparty.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrance hated England. That haughty government had long been the most\\r\\nunpopular on the globe. England had made great conquests from France,\\r\\nand was rich, intelligent and powerful beyond any other nation.\\r\\nProsperity had given her arrogance, and she had placed her heel upon\\r\\nher humiliated neighbors. There was not a court in Europe which would\\r\\nnot have rejoiced to see England humbled. The despotic court of\\r\\nFrance, and the most haughty nobles, were ready to encounter any\\r\\nperils which held out a reasonable hope that England might be\\r\\nweakened. Thus the sympathies of all France were united in favor of\\r\\nAmerica.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now the hour had come. By aiding the Americans, who had boldly\\r\\ndeclared their independence, they might not only deprive England of\\r\\nthose colonies whose trade was already invaluable to England, and\\r\\nwhich were rapidly increasing in population, wealth and power, but\\r\\nalso they might awaken such gratitude in the bosoms of Americans, that\\r\\nthe trade of the new nation would be mainly transferred to France.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus the court and the nobles, intent upon this object, did not\\r\\nhesitate to aid in the establishment of those principles of liberty,\\r\\nfraternity and equality in America, which eventually whelmed in ruin\\r\\nthe palaces and the castles of France.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was deemed important to conceal, as long as possible, from the\\r\\nBritish government the sympathy and aid which France was about to\\r\\nmanifest for the Americans. Arthur Lee reported that an agent of the\\r\\nFrench government had promised to send from Holland, two thousand\\r\\npounds worth of military stores. They were to be forwarded to one of\\r\\nthe French West India islands, ostensibly for the service of those\\r\\nislands. The governor was, however, instructed to surrender them to a\\r\\nsecret agent of the American Congress. The plan failed. I have not\\r\\nspace to record all the various stratagems which were devised to aid\\r\\nthe Americans, while the movement was carefully concealed from the\\r\\nvigilant eyes of the English.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin, with nobility of soul which should command the love of every\\r\\nAmerican, as one of his last deeds before he left his country perhaps\\r\\nnever to return, collected all the money he could command, about\\r\\ntwelve thousand dollars, and loaned it to the government, whose\\r\\ntreasury was utterly impoverished. In those dark days, even that small\\r\\nsum was of essential aid. In one of the last of Franklin\\'s letters,\\r\\nbefore he sailed, he wrote,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"As to our public affairs, I hope our people will keep up\\r\\n     their courage. I have no doubt of their finally succeeding\\r\\n     by the blessing of God; nor have I any doubt that so good a\\r\\n     cause will fail of that blessing. It is computed that we\\r\\n     have already taken a million sterling from the enemy. They\\r\\n     must soon be sick of their piratical project.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin embarked in the Reprisal, a rapid sailing sloop of war of\\r\\nsixteen guns. He took with him his grandson, William Temple Franklin,\\r\\nson of the Tory governor, then a very handsome boy of eighteen, and\\r\\nBenjamin Franklin Bache, eldest son of his daughter, a lad of seven\\r\\nyears. William Temple Franklin adhered firmly to the political views\\r\\nof his grandfather. Dr. Franklin intended to place Benjamin in a\\r\\nschool in Paris.\\r\\n\\r\\nTory spies were watching every movement of Congress. This mission to\\r\\nFrance was kept a profound secret. Had the British government known\\r\\nthat Benjamin Franklin was about to cross the ocean, almost every ship\\r\\nin the British navy would have been sent in chase of him. On the 26th\\r\\nof October, 1776, he left Philadelphia, every precaution having been\\r\\nadopted to keep his departure a secret. The vessel was at anchor at\\r\\nMarcus Hook, in the Delaware, three miles beyond Chester.\\r\\n\\r\\nFierce gales drove them rapidly across the Atlantic. Captain Wickes\\r\\nhad received instructions to avoid fighting, if possible. He was to\\r\\ndevote all his energies to transporting his precious passenger as\\r\\nrapidly as possible, from shore to shore. They were often chased by\\r\\ncruisers. The vessel was small, and Franklin, in his old age, was\\r\\nsadly cramped by his narrow accommodations. He says that of all his\\r\\neight voyages this was the most distressing. When near the coast of\\r\\nFrance they captured an English brig, with a cargo of lumber and wine.\\r\\nOn the afternoon of the same day, they took another brig, loaded with\\r\\nbrandy and flax seed. England was almost delirious with rage, in\\r\\nfinding that the Americans were bearing away their prizes from the\\r\\nchannel itself, thus bidding proud defiance to those frigates and\\r\\nfortresses of Great Britain which had overawed the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 29th of November the Reprisal cast anchor in Quiberon Bay.\\r\\nFranklin there obtained a post chaise to convey him to Nantes. He\\r\\nwrites,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The carriage was a miserable one, with tired horses, the\\r\\n     evening dark, scarce a traveller but ourselves on the road.\\r\\n     And to make it more _comfortable_, the driver stopped near a\\r\\n     wood we were to pass through, to tell us that a gang of\\r\\n     eighteen robbers infested that wood, who, but two weeks ago,\\r\\n     had robbed and murdered some travellers on that very spot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThough absolutely no one in Europe knew that Franklin was expected,\\r\\nhis fame had preceded him. The scientists of France were eager to\\r\\nrender him their homage. French statesmen had learned, at the Court of\\r\\nSt. James, to respect his grandeur of character, and his diplomatic\\r\\nabilities. He was a very handsome man, with a genial smile, which won\\r\\nlove at sight. The invariable remark of every one, who chanced to meet\\r\\nhim for five minutes was, \"What a delightful man.\" Franklin had none\\r\\nof the brusqueness which characterizes John Bull. He was always a\\r\\ngentleman, scrupulously attentive to his rich, elegant, yet simple\\r\\ndress. He manifested his knowledge of human nature, in carefully\\r\\npreserving his national garb,--the old continental costume.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus wherever he appeared he attracted attention. No man was ever more\\r\\ncourteous. The French Court, at that time, was bound by the shackles\\r\\nof etiquette, to an almost inconceivable degree. But Franklin was\\r\\nnever embarrassed. He needed no one to teach him etiquette. Instinct\\r\\ntaught him what to do, so that, in the bearing of a well bred\\r\\ngentleman, he was a model man, even in the court where Louis XIV. and\\r\\nLouis XV. had reigned with omnipotent sway. The most beautiful\\r\\nduchess, radiant in her courtly costume, and glittering with jewels,\\r\\nfelt proud of being seated on the sofa by the side of this true\\r\\ngentleman, whose dress, simple as it was, was in harmony with her own.\\r\\nThe popular impression is entirely an erroneous one, that there was\\r\\nanything rustic, anything which reminded one of the work shop or the\\r\\n_blouse_, in the demeanor of Benjamin Franklin, as he moved,\\r\\nunembarrassed, in the highest circles of fashion then known in the\\r\\nworld.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin was received to the hospitalities of a French gentleman of\\r\\nwealth and distinction, by the name of Gruel. His elegant apartments\\r\\nwere always crowded with visitors, eager to manifest their respect for\\r\\nthe trans-Atlantic philosopher. Horace Walpole, a warm friend of the\\r\\nAmericans, wrote,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"An account came that Dr. Franklin, at the age of 72, or 74,\\r\\n     and, at the risk of his head, had bravely embarked, on board\\r\\n     an American frigate, and, with two prizes taken on the way,\\r\\n     had landed, at Nantes, in France, and was to be at Paris on\\r\\n     the 14th, where the highest admiration and expectation of\\r\\n     him were raised.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon his arrival Mr. Deane exultingly wrote, \"Here is the hero and\\r\\nphilosopher, and patriot, all united in this celebrated American, who,\\r\\nat the age of seventy four, risks all dangers for his country.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIV.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The Struggles of Diplomacy._\\r\\n\\r\\n     Anecdote of Gibbon--John Adams--Residence at\\r\\n     Passy--Lafayette introduced--Cruise of the Reprisal--Paul\\r\\n     Jones--Capture of Burgoyne--Alliance with France--Anecdote\\r\\n     of the Cake--Excitement in England--Franklin\\'s introduction\\r\\n     to the king--Joy in America--Extraordinary letter of Count\\r\\n     Wissenstein--The reply--Injustice to Paul Jones--French\\r\\n     troops in America--Character of John Adams--Franklin\\'s\\r\\n     mature views of human nature--Anecdote of the Angel--Capture\\r\\n     of Cornwallis--Its effect in England--Prejudices of Mr.\\r\\n     Jay--Testimony of Dr. Sparks--Jealousy of Franklin--Shrewd\\r\\n     diplomatic act--The treaty signed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the journey from Nantes to Paris, a curious incident occurred,\\r\\nwhich is well worth recording. It so admirably illustrates the\\r\\ncharacter of two distinguished men, as to bear internal evidence of\\r\\nits truthfulness. At one of the inns, at which Franklin stopped, he\\r\\nwas informed that Mr. Gibbon, the illustrious author of the \"Decline\\r\\nand Fall of the Roman Empire,\" was also tarrying.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gibbon was an Englishman. He was a deist, being in entire sympathy\\r\\nwith Franklin in his views of Christianity. He was also a man of\\r\\nletters. Mr. Franklin addressed a very polite note to Mr. Gibbon,\\r\\nsending his compliments, and soliciting the pleasure of spending the\\r\\nevening with him. Mr. Gibbon, who was never renowned for amiability of\\r\\ncharacter, replied, in substance, we have not his exact words,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Notwithstanding my regard for Dr. Franklin, as a man and a\\r\\nphilosopher, I cannot reconcile it with my duty to my king, to have\\r\\nany conversation with a revolted subject.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin responded to this by writing, \"Though Mr. Gibbon\\'s principles\\r\\nhave compelled him to withhold the pleasure of his conversation, Dr.\\r\\nFranklin has still such a respect for the character of Mr. Gibbon, as\\r\\na gentleman and a historian, that when, in the course of his writing\\r\\nthe history of the \\'Decline and Fall of Empires,\\' the decline and fall\\r\\nof the British Empire shall come to be his subject, as will probably\\r\\nsoon be the case, Dr. Franklin would be happy to furnish him with\\r\\nample materials, which are in his possession.\"[28]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 28: This anecdote has had a wide circulation in the\\r\\nnewspapers. Mr. William Cobbett inserts it in his \"Works,\" with the\\r\\nfollowing comment, characteristic of the spirit of most of the higher\\r\\nclass of Englishmen, in those days:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whether this anecdote record a truth or not I shall not pretend to\\r\\nsay. But it must be confessed, that the expressions imputed to the two\\r\\npersonages were strictly in character. In Gibbon, we see the faithful\\r\\nsubject, and the man of candor and honor. In Franklin the treacherous\\r\\nand malicious old Zanga, of Boston.\"--_Works of William Cobbett. Vol.\\r\\nvii, p. 244._]\\r\\n\\r\\nGibbon was a Tory. He supported Lord North in all his measures. The\\r\\ngovernment rewarded him with a pension of eight hundred pounds a year.\\r\\nThis was equivalent to considerable more than four thousand dollars\\r\\nat the present time. Franklin was received, in Paris, by the whole\\r\\npopulation, court and _canaille_, with enthusiasm which that excitable\\r\\ncapital had rarely witnessed. The most humble of the population were\\r\\nfamiliar with the pithy sayings of Poor Richard. The _savants_\\r\\nadmitted their obligations to him, for the solution of some of the\\r\\nmost difficult problems of philosophy. The fashionable world\\r\\nwere delighted with his urbanity; and in his society found rare\\r\\nand unequalled pleasure. The republicans regarded him as the\\r\\npersonification of a free government; and even the nobles and the\\r\\nministry were cheered by the hope that, with his aid, haughty England\\r\\ncould be weakened and humbled, and that thus a new era of commercial\\r\\nprosperity was about to dawn upon France.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Adams was not popular in Paris. He was a man of great abilities,\\r\\nof irreproachable character, and was animated by as pure principles of\\r\\npatriotism as ever glowed in a human bosom. But he was a genuine\\r\\nPuritan, inheriting the virtues and the foibles of the best of that\\r\\nclass. Though not wanting in magnanimity, he could not fail from being\\r\\ndisturbed, by the caresses with which Franklin was ever greeted,\\r\\ncontrasted with the cold and respectful courtesy with which he was\\r\\nreceived. It was always the same, in the Court, in the saloons, and on\\r\\nthe Boulevards. In Mr. Adams\\' diary, written some years later, we find\\r\\nthe following insertion, which, in some degree, reveals his feelings.\\r\\nHe is recording a conversation with the French minister.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"All religions,\" said Marbois, \"are tolerated in America.\\r\\n     The ambassadors have a right, in all the courts of Europe,\\r\\n     to a chapel in their own way. But Mr. Franklin never had\\r\\n     any.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"No,\" said I laughing, \"because Mr. Franklin has no----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     I was going to say what I did not say, and will not say\\r\\n     here. I stopped short, and laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"No,\" said M. Marbois. \"Mr. Franklin adores only great\\r\\n     Nature; which has interested a great many people of both\\r\\n     sexes in his favor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Yes,\" said I laughing, \"all the atheists, deists and\\r\\n     libertines, as well as the philosophers and ladies are in\\r\\n     his train.\"[29]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 29: Works of John Adams, Vol. III, p. 220.]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe English lords were exasperated by the reception France had given\\r\\nFranklin. They fully comprehended its significance. France was in\\r\\nsympathy with the Americans, in their heroic endeavor to escape from\\r\\nthe despotism of the British crown. Thus the traffic which had\\r\\nenriched England, would be transferred to France.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven the Earl of Chatham said, in one of the most eloquent of his\\r\\nspeeches,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"France, my lords, has insulted you. She has encouraged and sustained\\r\\nAmerica. And whether America be wrong or right, the dignity of\\r\\nthis country ought to spurn at the officiousness of the French\\r\\ninterference. The ministers and ambassadors of those who are called\\r\\nrebels, are in Paris. In Paris they transact the reciprocal business\\r\\nof America and France. Can there be a more mortifying insult? Can even\\r\\nour ministers sustain a more humiliating disgrace? Do they dare to\\r\\nresent it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin was assailed in England, in innumerable pamphlets of abuse.\\r\\nThe sin of his youth still pursued him. Many an envenomed arrow\\r\\npierced his heart.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 30: This is a delicate subject, but it must not be ignored.\\r\\nMr. Parton writes,--\"One penny-a-liner informed the public that Dr.\\r\\nFranklin had a son, who, though illegitimate, was a much more honest\\r\\nman than his father. As to the mother of that son, nothing was known\\r\\nof her, except that her seducer let her die in the streets.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no end to those attacks. They were attended by every\\r\\nexaggeration of malignity which hatred could engender. It is certain\\r\\nthat Franklin would have been saved from these woes could he, as a\\r\\nyoung man, have embraced the _faith_ of the religion of Jesus, and\\r\\ndeveloped that _faith_ in his _practice_.]\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it must not be forgotten that there were many of the noblest men\\r\\nin England, who were the warm friends of Franklin, and who cordially\\r\\nespoused the American cause. Among these were Fox, Burke, Rockingham,\\r\\nShelburne, Chatham, Priestley and Price.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany beautiful villages surrounded Paris. One of the most lovely,\\r\\nembowered in foliage, was Passy. It is now included within the city\\r\\nwalls. It was then but two miles from the centre of the city. A\\r\\nmunificent friend of America, M. de Chaumont, invited Franklin to the\\r\\nhospitality of one of his sumptuous mansions in that place. Franklin\\r\\naccepted the invitation, assuring him that at the close of the war,\\r\\nCongress would insist upon granting him a tract of land, in\\r\\nrecognition of his kindness to America in the hour of need.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in the year 1777, Franklin took up his residence at Passy, and\\r\\nthere he continued to reside while he remained in France. He lived\\r\\nliberally, had an ample retinue of servants, and entertained his\\r\\nguests with elegance. His annual expenditures were about thirteen\\r\\nthousand dollars. This sum would then purchase twice the amount of\\r\\nconveniences and luxuries which could be purchased by the same sum at\\r\\nthe present day. He had his own servants, and commanded a handsome\\r\\ncarriage with two horses.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Adams writes, \"With seven servants, and hiring a charwoman upon\\r\\noccasion of company, we may possibly keep house. With less we should\\r\\nbe hooted at as ridiculous, and could not entertain any company.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Franklin took every thing by the smooth handle, he did not, on\\r\\nthat account, intermit any intensity of labor to accomplish his\\r\\npurposes. There were then three American envoys in Paris, Franklin,\\r\\nDeane, and Lee. Five days after the arrival of Franklin, they, on the\\r\\n28th of December, 1777, held their first interview with the French\\r\\nMinister, Count de Vergennes. They were received with all that\\r\\ncordiality and courtesy which are marked characteristics of the French\\r\\npeople. But still the commissioners were embarrassed. The prospects of\\r\\nAmerica were doubtful. General Burgoyne was on the eve of sailing for\\r\\nAmerica with a formidable fleet, and an army of eight or ten thousand\\r\\nhighly disciplined troops. In the course of the conversation, the\\r\\nminister said that France was not yet ready to enter into open\\r\\ncollision with England, and to declare war.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" said he, \"if a _couple of millions_ of francs, to be repaid\\r\\nwithout interest after the war, will be of use to you, they are at\\r\\nyour service. Only do not say that you had it from _us_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was indeed, under the doubtful circumstances, a very generous\\r\\noffer. It was at this dark hour that the noble Lafayette decided to\\r\\nconsecrate his fortune, and to peril his life, for the cause of\\r\\nAmerican freedom. It was proclaimed that Burgoyne\\'s expedition was\\r\\nfitted out to rouse the slaves to insurrection, and to lay the\\r\\nmansions of the planters in ashes. Arthur Lee was very much alarmed.\\r\\nThese splendid estates were generally situated in romantic spots, upon\\r\\nthe banks of the navigable rivers, where the dwellings, often quite\\r\\nmagnificent, could easily be demolished by shot and shell thrown from\\r\\nany frigate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Reprisal, Captain Wickes, was the first American vessel of war\\r\\nwhich ventured into European waters. The channel swarmed with British\\r\\nvessels. The Reprisal took prize after prize, and conveyed them into\\r\\nNantes. As France was not at war with England, Count de Vergennes was\\r\\ncompelled to order the Reprisal, with her prizes, to leave the harbor.\\r\\nCaptain Wickes took some of the Nantes merchants on board his vessel,\\r\\nand, just outside the port, sold the prizes to them. The French\\r\\nmerchants then returned, with their property, into the harbor.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Wickes soon united with him the Lexington of fourteen guns,\\r\\nand a cutter, the Dolphin, of ten guns. With this little fleet the\\r\\nhero sailed completely around Ireland, capturing or destroying sixteen\\r\\nprizes. The British were astounded at this audacity. Merchants and\\r\\nunder-writers were quite terror-stricken. They had never dreamed that\\r\\nthe despised Americans could strike _them_ any blows. And when, soon\\r\\nafter, Paul Jones, one of the noblest of all naval heroes, appeared in\\r\\ntheir waters, it is not too much to say that _consternation_ pervaded\\r\\nthe coasts of both England and Ireland.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 31: The wonderful achievements of this patriot are fully\\r\\nrecorded in one of the volumes of this series.]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt requires many and aggravated wrongs to rouse a naturally amiable\\r\\nman to the highest pitch of indignation. But when thus roused, he is\\r\\nready for any vigor of action. Franklin\\'s blood was up. England was\\r\\nbribing slaves to murder their masters; was rousing the savages to\\r\\nmassacre the families of poor, hard-working frontiersmen; was wantonly\\r\\nbombarding defenceless seaports, and with inhumanity, rarely known in\\r\\ncivilized warfare, was laying villages in ashes, consigning women and\\r\\nchildren to beggary and starvation. In the prison hulks of New York,\\r\\nour most illustrious men were in the endurance, as prisoners of war,\\r\\nof woes unsurpassed by Algerine barbarism. Many of our common\\r\\nsailors, England was compelling, by the terrors of the lash, to man\\r\\nher ships, and to fight their own countrymen. Maddened by these\\r\\natrocities, Mr. Franklin wrote to his English friend, David Hartley, a\\r\\nmember of Parliament, a letter, which all the few friends of America\\r\\nin England, read with great satisfaction, and which must have produced\\r\\na very powerful moral impression in France. It is too long to be\\r\\ninserted here. In conclusion he said to his friend,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"In reviewing what I have written, I found too much warmth in\\r\\n     it, and was about to strike out some parts. Yet I let them\\r\\n     go, as it will afford you this one reflection,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"\\'If a man naturally cool, and rendered still cooler by old\\r\\n     age, is so warmed by our treatment of his country, how much\\r\\n     must those people in general be exasperated against us. And\\r\\n     why are we making inveterate enemies, by our barbarity, not\\r\\n     only of the present inhabitants of a great country, but of\\r\\n     their infinitely more numerous posterity; who will, in\\r\\n     future ages, detest the name of Englishman, as much as the\\r\\n     children in Holland now do those of Alva and Spaniard.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam Temple Franklin inherited the attractions of person, and the\\r\\nfascination of manners, so conspicuous in his grandfather. He was a\\r\\ngreat favorite in the social circles of the gay metropolis. Dark days\\r\\ncame, with tidings of discomfiture. Franklin devoted twelve hours out\\r\\nof the twenty-four, to the arduous duties of his mission. Philadelphia\\r\\nfell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Doctor,\" said an Englishman in Paris, with the customary\\r\\ncourtesy of his nation, \"Howe has taken Philadelphia.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg your pardon,\" Franklin replied, \"Philadelphia has taken Howe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result proved that Franklin\\'s joke was almost a reality.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurgoyne surrendered. His whole army was taken captive. Massachusetts\\r\\nimmediately sent John Loring Austin to convey the rapturous tidings to\\r\\nFranklin. This great success would doubtless encourage France to open\\r\\naction. No tongue can tell the emotions excited in the bosoms of\\r\\nFranklin, Lee and Deane, as Austin entered their presence at Passy,\\r\\nwith the announcement, \"_General Burgoyne and his whole army are\\r\\nprisoners of war._\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were no shoutings, no rushing into each other\\'s arms. But tears\\r\\nfilled their eyes. They felt assured that France would come openly to\\r\\ntheir aid, and that the independence of their country was no longer\\r\\ndoubtful. Silently they returned to Franklin\\'s spacious apartment,\\r\\nwhere they spent the whole day in reading the enrapturing dispatches,\\r\\nand in preparing for immediate alliance with France. France made no\\r\\nattempt to conceal its joy. A treaty of alliance was soon formed.\\r\\nNobly the Count de Vergennes said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We wish to take no advantage of your situation. We desire no terms\\r\\nwhich you may hereafter regret having made; but would enter into\\r\\narrangements of mutual interest, which may last as long as human\\r\\ninstitutions endure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEngland was now greatly alarmed from fear that the trade of the\\r\\ncolonies might be transferred to France. Envoys were sent to Passy to\\r\\noffer the American ambassadors everything they had demanded at the\\r\\ncommencement of the conflict. But it was too late. America now\\r\\ndemanded _Independence_, and would accept nothing less.\\r\\n\\r\\nA large cake was one day sent to the ambassador\\'s apartment, at Passy,\\r\\nwith the inscription \"Le Digne Franklin,\" the worthy Franklin. Mr. Lee\\r\\nsaid, \"Well, Doctor, we have to thank you for our accommodations, and\\r\\nto appropriate your present to our use.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all,\" said Franklin. \"This cake is for all the Commissioners.\\r\\nThe French, not being able to write good English, do not spell our\\r\\nnames correctly. The meaning doubtless is Lee, Deane, Franklin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe memorable treaty was signed on the 5th of February, 1778. It was\\r\\nstated that the object of the treaty was to establish the independence\\r\\nof the United States, and that neither party should conclude either\\r\\ntruce or peace with England, without the consent of the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nTidings of the treaty, which for a short time was kept secret, had\\r\\nbeen whispered in England, causing intense excitement. On the 17th of\\r\\nFebruary, 1778, the House of Parliament was crowded. Lord North, amid\\r\\nbreathless silence, presented a \"Conciliation Bill,\" granting\\r\\neverything which Franklin had demanded. Fox, who was in the\\r\\nOpposition, arose and announced the treaty. \"The astonishment,\" writes\\r\\nWalpole, \"was totally indescribable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon the fact of the treaty of alliance, was formally announced in\\r\\nFrance. The American envoys were invited to an audience with the king.\\r\\nFranklin was richly dressed. His hair was carefully arranged by a\\r\\nFrench perruquier. He wore an admirably fitting suit of plain, black,\\r\\nsilk velvet. Ruffles of elaborate embroidery and snowy whiteness\\r\\nadorned his wrists and bosom. White silk stockings aided in displaying\\r\\nthe perfect proportions of his frame. Large silver buckles were on his\\r\\nshoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one could accuse him of failing in due respect for the king, by\\r\\nappearing in his presence in slatternly dress. His costume was superb,\\r\\nand was such as was then worn, on important occasions, by American\\r\\ngentlemen of the highest rank. The audience took place at Versailles,\\r\\non the morning of the 20th of March. Each of the American envoys rode\\r\\nin his own carriage, attended by the usual retinue of servants. On the\\r\\nway they were cheered with the utmost enthusiasm by the crowd. The\\r\\nking, Louis XVI., received them with extreme courtesy, and the queen,\\r\\nMarie Antoinette, was marked in her attentions to Franklin. The\\r\\nBritish ambassador, Lord Stormont, was so enraged, that, regardless of\\r\\nall the claims of courtesy, he immediately returned to England,\\r\\nwithout even taking leave of the king.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho can describe the exultation, the rapture, the tears, with which\\r\\nthese tidings were received by the patriots of America. On the 6th\\r\\nof May, George Washington drew up his little band at Valley Forge,\\r\\nto announce the great event, and to offer to God prayers and\\r\\nthanksgivings. The tone of the English was immediately changed. They\\r\\nabandoned threats and tried the effect of entreaties. Several\\r\\nemissaries, from the government, approached Dr. Franklin, all bearing\\r\\nin substance the same message. They said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We cannot endure the thought that our beloved colonists should enter\\r\\ninto alliance with our hereditary natural enemy, France. Can you, who\\r\\nare Protestants, consent to unite with a nation of Roman Catholics? If\\r\\nyou will remain firm in your adhesion to England, we will grant you\\r\\nall you ever wished for, and even more. But do not forsake your mother\\r\\ncountry to swell the pride and power of perfidious France.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut all these efforts were unavailing. The colonists began to despise\\r\\nEngland. They had no wish for war with their unnatural parent, and\\r\\nthey knew that their independence was assured; and that no efforts\\r\\nwhich England could possibly make, could now prevent it. All alike\\r\\nfelt disposed to spurn the bribes which England so lavishly offered.\\r\\n\\r\\nA very extraordinary letter was sent to Dr. Franklin, which was\\r\\nsigned, Charles de Wissenstein. Franklin, who was accustomed to\\r\\nsifting evidence, became satisfied that the message came from king\\r\\nGeorge III. himself. The letter declared that the perfidious French\\r\\nwould certainly deceive the Americans with false promises, and defraud\\r\\nthem. After making the most liberal offers of popular rights, if the\\r\\nAmericans would continue to remain colonists under the British crown,\\r\\nthe document presented the following extraordinary promise to those\\r\\nAmerican patriots whom England had denounced as traitors, and doomed\\r\\nto be hung. It was deemed a bribe which human virtue could not resist.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"As it is unreasonable that their (the American patriots)\\r\\n     services to their country should deprive them of those\\r\\n     advantages which their talents would otherwise have gained\\r\\n     them, the following persons shall have offices or pensions\\r\\n     for life, at their option, namely, Franklin, Washington,\\r\\n     Adams, Hancock, etc. In case his Majesty, or his successors,\\r\\n     should ever create American peers, then those persons, or\\r\\n     their descendants, shall be among the first created if they\\r\\n     choose it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin, after conference with his colleagues, replied to the letter.\\r\\nHis soul was all on fire with the insults our country had received,\\r\\nand the wrongs she had endured. He wrote as if personally addressing\\r\\nthe king. We can only give the concluding paragraph. After stating\\r\\nthat the independence of America was secured, that all attempts of\\r\\nEngland to prevent it would be impotent, and that consequently it was\\r\\nquite a matter of indifference to the Americans whether England\\r\\nacknowledged it or not, he wrote,[32]\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"This proposition, of delivering ourselves bound and gagged,\\r\\n     ready for hanging, without even a right to complain, and\\r\\n     without a friend to be found afterward among all mankind,\\r\\n     you would have us embrace upon the faith of an Act of\\r\\n     Parliament. Good God! an act of your Parliament. This\\r\\n     demonstrates that you do not yet know us; and that you fancy\\r\\n     that we do not know you. But it is not merely this flimsy\\r\\n     faith that we are to act upon. You offer us hope, the hope\\r\\n     of PLACES, PENSIONS and PEERAGES.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"These, judging from yourselves, you think are motives\\r\\n     irresistible. This offer to corrupt us, sir, is with me,\\r\\n     your credential; and convinces me that you are not a private\\r\\n     volunteer in your application. It bears the stamp of British\\r\\n     Court character. It is even the signature of your king. But\\r\\n     think, for a moment, in what light it must be viewed in\\r\\n     America.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"By PLACES, you mean places among us; for you take care, by\\r\\n     a special article, to secure your own to yourselves. We must\\r\\n     then pay the salaries in order to enrich ourselves with\\r\\n     those places. But you will give us PENSIONS, probably to be\\r\\n     paid too out of your expected American revenue, and which\\r\\n     none of us can accept without deserving, and perhaps\\r\\n     obtaining, _suspension_.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"PEERAGES! Alas! in our long observation of the vast servile\\r\\n     majority of your peers, voting constantly for every measure\\r\\n     proposed by a minister, however weak or wicked, leaves us\\r\\n     small respect for that title. We consider it as a sort of\\r\\n     tar-and-feather honor, or a mixture of foulness and folly,\\r\\n     which every man among us, who should accept it from your\\r\\n     king, would be obliged to renounce, or exchange for that\\r\\n     confessed by the mobs of their own country, or wear it with\\r\\n     everlasting infamy.\"[33]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 32: In reference to the promises contained in the letter,\\r\\nFranklin referred to a book which it was said George III. had\\r\\ncarefully studied, called _Arcana Imperii_. A prince, to appease a\\r\\nrevolt, had promised indemnity to the revolters. The question was\\r\\nsubmitted to the keepers of the king\\'s conscience, whether he were\\r\\nbound to keep his promises. The reply was,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No! It was right to make the promises, because the revolt could not\\r\\notherwise be suppressed. It would be wrong to keep them, because\\r\\nrevolters ought to be punished.\"]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 33: Sparks\\' Franklin, Vol. iii, p. 278.]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the spring of 1778, Paul Jones entered upon his brilliant career,\\r\\nbidding defiance, with his infant fleet, to all the naval power of\\r\\nGreat Britain, agitating entire England with the terror of his name.\\r\\nFranklin was his affectionate friend, and, in all his many trials, he\\r\\nleaned upon Franklin for sympathy. So tremendously was he maligned by\\r\\nthe English press, that American historians, unconsciously thus\\r\\ninfluenced, have never done him justice. As a patriot, and a noble\\r\\nman, he deserves to take rank with his friends, Washington and\\r\\nFranklin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1779, Lafayette, returning to France, from America, brought the\\r\\nnews that Franklin was appointed by Congress as sole plenipotentiary\\r\\nof the new nation of the United States, to the generous kingdom, which\\r\\nhad acknowledged our independence, and whose fleets and armies were\\r\\nnow united with ours. All France rejoiced. With great eclat the new\\r\\nambassadors were presented to the king.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo man of force of character can escape having enemies. Franklin had\\r\\nmany and bitter ones. A cabal plotted the removal of his excellent\\r\\ngrandson, William Temple Franklin. It gives us an insight to the heart\\r\\nof this venerable septuagenarian to read from his pen,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"It is enough that I have lost my son. Would they add my\\r\\n     _grandson_. An old man of seventy, I undertook a winter\\r\\n     voyage, at the command of Congress, with no other attendant\\r\\n     to take care of me. I am continued here, in a foreign\\r\\n     country, where, if I am sick, his filial attention comforts\\r\\n     me. And if I die, I have a child to close my eyes and take\\r\\n     care of my remains. His dutiful behavior toward me, and his\\r\\n     diligence and fidelity in business, are both pleasing and\\r\\n     useful to me. His conduct, as my private secretary, has been\\r\\n     unexceptionable; and I am confident the Congress will never\\r\\n     think of separating us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin\\'s great endeavor now was to obtain money. Without it we\\r\\ncould have neither fleet nor army. The treasury of France was empty,\\r\\nalmost to bankruptcy. Never did he struggle against greater obstacles\\r\\nthan during the next three years. It has been truly said, that\\r\\nFranklin, without intending it, helped to bleed the French monarchy to\\r\\ndeath. In addition to the employment of both army and navy, the French\\r\\ngovernment conferred upon Congress, in gifts or loans, the sum of\\r\\ntwenty-six million francs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French troops were received in America with boundless enthusiasm.\\r\\nTheir discipline was admirable. Their respect for the rights of\\r\\nproperty was such, that not a barn, orchard or hen-roost was robbed.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Adams was sent to join Franklin, to aid him in framing terms of\\r\\npeace, whenever England should be disposed to make such advances. He\\r\\nwas a man of great abilities, of irreproachable integrity, but he had\\r\\ninherited, from his English ancestry, not only repulsive brusqueness,\\r\\nbut also a prejudice against the French, which nothing could remove.\\r\\nHis want of courtesy; his unconcealed assumption that France was\\r\\nacting out of unmitigated selfishness, and that consequently the\\r\\nAmericans owed the French no debt of gratitude, often caused Franklin\\r\\nmuch embarrassment. This blunt man, at one time wrote so uncourteous,\\r\\nnot to say insulting a letter, to M. de Vergennes, that the French\\r\\nminister declined having any more correspondence with him. Both\\r\\nFranklin and Congress condemned the incivility of Mr. Adams. He only\\r\\nescaped a motion of censure from the full conviction of Congress of\\r\\nthe purity of his patriotism, and of his intentions.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 34: Mr. Jefferson, after an intimacy of seven months with\\r\\nJohn Adams, in Paris, wrote of him: \"He is vain, irritable, and a bad\\r\\ncalculator of the force and probable effect of the motives which\\r\\ngovern men. This is all the ill which can possibly be said of him. He\\r\\nis as disinterested as the Being who made him.\"]\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin had been requested to forward the correspondence to Congress.\\r\\nAs in duty bound, he did so; accompanying it with a magnanimous\\r\\nletter. Mr. Adams was very angry. Every impartial reader will admit\\r\\nthat, in this embarrassing affair, Franklin conducted with delicacy\\r\\nand discretion. The British troops in America were still conducting\\r\\nlike savages. Congress requested Franklin to prepare a school-book,\\r\\nwith thirty-five prints, each depicting one or more of the acts of\\r\\nEnglish brutality. The object was to impress the minds of children\\r\\nwith a deep sense of the insatiable and bloody malice with which the\\r\\nEnglish had pursued the Americans. The plan was never executed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the year 1781, Franklin, then seventy-five years of age, and having\\r\\nbeen engaged in public service for fifty years, wrote to Congress,\\r\\nbegging permission to retire from his responsible office. Congress\\r\\ncould not spare his services. They gave him an additional appointment.\\r\\nHe was commissioned to unite with Adams and Jay, in those negotiations\\r\\nfor peace which, it was evident, must soon take place.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin loved the French, he could smile at their foibles, in\\r\\ndressing their hair so that they could not wear a hat, but were\\r\\ncompelled to carry it under their arms; also in filling their noses\\r\\nwith tobacco. \"These,\" said he, \"are mere follies. There is nothing\\r\\nwanting, in the character of a Frenchman, that belongs to that of an\\r\\nagreeable and worthy man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may perhaps be mentioned, as a defect in the character of Franklin,\\r\\nthat when in France he could see nothing but the beautiful. His eye\\r\\nwas turned from every revolting spectacle. In the society of elegantly\\r\\ndressed, highly educated, refined French ladies,--at dinner parties,\\r\\nglittering with gold and silver plate,--in social intercourse with men\\r\\nwhose philosophical attainments were of the highest order, and whose\\r\\npoliteness of speech and bearing rendered them delightful companions,\\r\\nFranklin found his time and thoughts engrossed. In all his voluminous\\r\\nwritings we find no allusion to those tremendous wrongs, which Louis\\r\\nXIV. and Louis XV. had entailed upon the people,--wrongs which soon\\r\\nconvulsed society with the volcanic throes of the French revolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nJefferson, who succeeded Franklin, was cast in a different mould. He\\r\\nsaw and fully comprehended the misery under which the millions of the\\r\\nFrench peasantry were groaning. And this led him to the conviction,\\r\\nthat no people could be safe, unless the government were placed in\\r\\ntheir own hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill Franklin, like his brother deists, Hume and Voltaire, seeing how\\r\\nimpotent were all the motives they could urge to make man virtuous,\\r\\nbecame thoroughly disgusted with human nature. He even went beyond\\r\\nPaul in his description of the hopeless depravity of man. The idea of\\r\\nreclaiming him by his philosophy was abandoned entirely. And yet he\\r\\nwas not prepared to embrace that gospel, which the experience of ages\\r\\nhas proved to be the \"wisdom of God and the power of God unto\\r\\nsalvation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He enlarges,\" writes Mr. Parton, \"upon this theme, in his most\\r\\ndelightful manner, in another letter to Dr. Priestley.\" In this letter\\r\\nhe says in his usual jocular strain, that the more he studies the\\r\\nmoral part of nature the more he is disgusted; that he finds men very\\r\\nbadly constructed; that they are more prone to do evil than to do\\r\\ngood; that they take great pleasure in killing one another, and that\\r\\nhe doubts whether the species is worth preserving. He intimates that\\r\\nevery attempt to save their souls is \"an idle amusement.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As you grow older,\" he writes, \"you may perhaps repent of having\\r\\nmurdered, in mephitic air, so many honest, harmless mice, and wish\\r\\nthat, to prevent mischief, you had used boys and girls instead of\\r\\nthem.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this singular letter he represents a young angel having been sent\\r\\nto this world, under the guidance of an old courier spirit. They\\r\\narrive over the seas of Martinico, in the midst of the horrible fight\\r\\nbetween the fleets of Rodney and De Grasse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When,\" he writes, \"through the clouds of smoke, he (the young angel)\\r\\nsaw the fire of the guns, the decks covered with mangled limbs and\\r\\nbodies, dead or dying; the ships sinking, burning, or blown into the\\r\\nair; and the quantity of pain, misery and destruction the crews, yet\\r\\nalive, were with so much eagerness dealing round to one another, he\\r\\nturned angrily to his guide and said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'You blundering blockhead; you are ignorant of your business. You\\r\\nundertook to conduct me to the earth; and you have brought me into\\r\\nhell.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'No sir,\\' said the guide, \\'I have made no such mistake. This is\\r\\nreally the earth, and these are men. Devils never treat one another in\\r\\nthis cruel manner. They have more sense, and more of what men (vainly)\\r\\ncall humanity.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was after the study of human nature, under the most favorable of\\r\\npossible circumstances, for more than three-quarters of a century,\\r\\nthat this philosopher wrote these terrible comments upon our fallen\\r\\nrace.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter part of October, 1781, Lord Cornwallis surrendered his\\r\\nwhole army, of over seven thousand men, at Yorktown. The French fleet\\r\\ncut off his escape by sea. Seven thousand French soldiers, united with\\r\\nfive thousand American troops, prevented any retreat by land. The\\r\\nAmericans had thus captured two British armies. It was in vain for\\r\\nEngland to think of sending a third. The conflict was virtually\\r\\ndecided.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Prime Minister,\" Lord North, it is said, \"received the tidings as\\r\\nhe would have taken a ball in his breast. He threw his arms apart. He\\r\\npaced wildly up and down the room, exclaiming, from time to time, \\'Oh\\r\\nGod! it is all over.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAll England now was clamoring against the war. Thousands of persons\\r\\nhad perished in the campaigns, and financial embarrassments had come\\r\\nto nearly all her institutions of industry. The English government\\r\\nmade vigorous endeavors, offering great bribes, to induce the American\\r\\nenvoys at Paris to abandon their French allies, and make a separate\\r\\npeace. Franklin wrote to Mr. Hartley, through whom he received these\\r\\nproposals,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I believe there is not a man in America, a few _English\\r\\n     Tories_ excepted, that would not spurn the thought of\\r\\n     deserting a noble and generous friend, for the sake of a\\r\\n     truce with an unjust and cruel enemy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBritish diplomacy tried all its arts of intrigue to separate America\\r\\nfrom France in the negotiations for peace, but all in vain. The\\r\\nBritish minister, Mr. Grenville, in an interview with Mr. Franklin,\\r\\nridiculed the idea that America owed France any gratitude, urging that\\r\\nFrance sought only her own selfish interests.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I told him,\" Franklin writes, \"that I was so strongly\\r\\n     impressed with the kind assistance afforded us by France, in\\r\\n     our distress, and the generous and noble manner in which it\\r\\n     was granted, without exacting or stipulating for a single\\r\\n     privilege, or particular advantage to herself in our commerce\\r\\n     or otherwise, that I could never suffer myself to think of\\r\\n     such reasonings for lessening the obligation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 28th of February, 1782, General Conway, one of the leaders of\\r\\nthe Opposition, the same who had moved the repeal of the stamp act,\\r\\nseventeen years before, presented a resolution in the House of Commons\\r\\nthat,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"THE REDUCTION OF THE COLONIES BY FORCE OF ARMS IS\\r\\n     IMPRACTICABLE.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA violent, even fierce debate ensued, which was continued until one\\r\\no\\'clock in the morning. Then the cry of _question_ became general.\\r\\nThe vote was carried by a majority of nineteen. This terminated\\r\\nthe American war. The people of England had decided against it.\\r\\n\"Acclamations,\" writes Wraxall, \"pierced the roof, and might have\\r\\nbeen heard in Westminster Hall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis great victory was followed by another resolve. It was an address\\r\\nto George III. soliciting him to \"Stop the prosecution of any further\\r\\nhostilities against the revolted colonies, for the purpose of reducing\\r\\nthem to obedience by force.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNotwithstanding the lateness of the hour, these votes were immediately\\r\\ncommunicated to the king, who was in a pitiable condition, aged,\\r\\nnearly blind, half crazed, and stubborn even to insanity, in his\\r\\ndetermination to subjugate the Americans. The poor old man, in his\\r\\nrage, threatened to abandon England, to renounce the crown, and to\\r\\ncloister himself in his estate of Hanover. He was however compelled\\r\\nto yield, to dismiss his Tory ministers and to accept a whig cabinet.\\r\\nEdmund Burke wrote a warm, congratulatory letter to Franklin.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 35: Edmund Burke wrote to Dr. Franklin that \"The motion was\\r\\nthe _declaration_ of two hundred and thirty four members; but it was\\r\\nthe _opinion_, he thought, of the whole house.\"]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now the final struggle arose respecting the terms of peace. The\\r\\nthree great questions discussed, as diplomatic arrangements, were\\r\\ngradually and very cautiously entered into, were: 1. What shall be the\\r\\nboundaries of the United States. 2. Shall the Americans be allowed to\\r\\nfish on the great banks. 3. What provision shall be made for the\\r\\nTories in America, whose estates have been confiscated?\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were many preliminary meetings, private, semi-official, and\\r\\nofficial. There was a general impression that Franklin was the man\\r\\nwhose opinion would entirely control that of his countrymen. He was\\r\\napproached in every way, and the utmost endeavors were made to induce\\r\\nthe American Commissioners to enter into a private treaty, without\\r\\nconsulting the French ministry.\\r\\n\\r\\nA full account of the diplomatic conflict which ensued, would fill a\\r\\nvolume. On one occasion the British minister, Mr. Grenville, said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In case England grants America Independence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French minister, M. de Vergennes, smiled and said, \"America has\\r\\nalready won her Independence. She does not ask it of you. There is Dr.\\r\\nFranklin; he will answer you on that point.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure,\" Franklin said, \"we do not consider it necessary to\\r\\nbargain for that which is our own. We have bought our Independence at\\r\\nthe expense of much blood and treasure, and are in full possession of\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of these preliminary interviews took place in Paris. The amount\\r\\nof money and blood which the pugnacious government of England had\\r\\nexpended in totally needless wars, can not be computed. The misery\\r\\nwith which those wars had deluged this unhappy globe, God only can\\r\\ncomprehend. Mr. Richard Oswald, a retired London merchant, of vast\\r\\nwealth, was sent, by Lord Shelburne, prime minister, as a confidential\\r\\nmessenger, to sound Dr. Franklin. He was frank in the extreme.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Peace,\" said he, \"is absolutely necessary for England. The nation has\\r\\nbeen foolishly involved in four wars, and can no longer raise money to\\r\\ncarry them on. If continued, it will be absolutely necessary to stop\\r\\nthe payment of interest money on the public debt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Adams and Mr. Jay were soon associated with Dr. Franklin in these\\r\\nnegotiations. Mr. Jay was in entire sympathy with Mr. Adams in his\\r\\nantipathy to the French. They both assumed that France was meanly\\r\\nseeking only her own interests, making use of America simply as an\\r\\ninstrument for the accomplishment of her selfish purposes.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 36: Mr. Adams wrote, in his diary, November, 1782, \"Mr. Jay\\r\\ndon\\'t like any Frenchman. The Marquis de la Fayette is clever, but he\\r\\nis a Frenchman.\"]\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Jared Sparks, after carefully examining, in the Office of Foreign\\r\\nAffairs in London, the correspondence of the French ministers with the\\r\\nAmerican envoys, during the whole war, writes,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"After examining the subject, with all the care and accuracy\\r\\n     which these means of information have enabled me to give to\\r\\n     it, I am prepared to express my belief, most fully, that Mr.\\r\\n     Jay was mistaken, both in regard to the aims of the French\\r\\n     court and the plans pursued by them to gain their supposed\\r\\n     ends.\"[37]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 37: Diplomatic Correspondence of the American Revolution, V.\\r\\nviii, p. 209.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Jay was so insanely suspicious of the French, that he was afraid\\r\\nthat the French ministry would send spies, to pick the locks in his\\r\\nlodgings, and steal his important papers. He therefore always carried\\r\\nthem about his person. He also believed that Count de Vergennes had\\r\\nactually proposed to the British minister, that they should unite\\r\\ntheir armies, seize the United States, and divide America between\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch were the colleagues united with Franklin, in the negotiations for\\r\\npeace. It required all his consummate wisdom to be able to guide\\r\\naffairs wisely under such difficult circumstances. It may be doubted\\r\\nwhether there was another man in America, who could have surmounted\\r\\nthe obstacles over which he triumphed. Both of Franklin\\'s colleagues\\r\\nregarded him with suspicion. They believed that he had been won over\\r\\nto such sympathy with the French, that he would be willing to\\r\\nsacrifice the interests of his own country to please them. They wrote\\r\\nletters home severely denouncing him; and they seemed to stand more in\\r\\nfear of France than of England.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Dr. Franklin,\" wrote Mr. Adams, \"is very staunch against the\\r\\n     Tories; more decided, a great deal, upon that point, than Mr.\\r\\n     Jay or myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British ministers insisted that the confiscated estates of the\\r\\nAmerican Tories should be restored to them, and all their losses\\r\\nreimbursed. Franklin silenced the demand by drawing from his pocket\\r\\nthe following articles, which he proposed should be added to the\\r\\ntreaty,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"It is agreed that his Britannic Majesty will earnestly\\r\\n     recommend it to his Parliament, to provide for and make a\\r\\n     compensation to the merchants and shop-keepers of Boston,\\r\\n     whose goods and merchandise were seized and taken out of\\r\\n     their stores, ware-houses and shops, by order of General\\r\\n     Gage, and others of his commanding officers there; and also\\r\\n     to the inhabitants of Philadelphia for the goods taken away\\r\\n     by his army there; and to make compensation also for the\\r\\n     tobacco, rice, indigo and negroes seized and carried off by\\r\\n     his armies, under Generals Arnold, Cornwallis and others,\\r\\n     from the States of Virginia, North and South Carolina and\\r\\n     Georgia, and for all the vessels and cargoes belonging to\\r\\n     the inhabitants of the said United States, which were\\r\\n     stopped, seized or taken, either in the ports or on the\\r\\n     seas, by his governors or by his ships of war, before the\\r\\n     declaration of war against the United States. And it is\\r\\n     further agreed that his Britannic Majesty will also\\r\\n     earnestly recommend it to his Parliament to make\\r\\n     compensation for all the towns, villages and farms, burnt\\r\\n     and destroyed by his troops, or adherents in these United\\r\\n     States.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three British commissioners were confounded by these counter\\r\\ndemands, and said not another word about reimbursing the American\\r\\nTories. On the 30th of November, 1782, the preliminaries were signed,\\r\\nsubject to the assent of the French ministers, who were also to submit\\r\\ntheir preliminaries to the American envoys. By these articles: 1. The\\r\\nboundaries were established. 2. The Americans could fish on the banks\\r\\nof Newfoundland, and cure their fish on the unsettled shores of Nova\\r\\nScotia and Labrador. 3. Congress was to recommend to the several\\r\\nStates, to restore the confiscated property of real British subjects.\\r\\n4. Private debts were to be paid. 5. There were to be no more\\r\\nconfiscations or prosecutions, on either side, for acts during the\\r\\nwar. 6. The British troops were to be withdrawn. 7. The navigation of\\r\\nthe Mississippi was declared to be free. 8. And any place captured,\\r\\nafter the signing of these articles, was to be restored.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 13th of January, Count de Vergennes, and the British minister\\r\\nMr. Fitzherbert, signed their preliminaries in the presence of Dr.\\r\\nFranklin and Mr. Adams. Not till then did the English order\\r\\nhostilities to be suspended, and declare the senseless war to be at an\\r\\nend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was universal satisfaction in America. With the exception of the\\r\\nking and a few of his ministers, there was general satisfaction in\\r\\nEngland. It is true that the national pride was sorely humiliated. But\\r\\nafter all these woes which England had inflicted upon America, her own\\r\\nstatesmen, with almost undivided voice, declared that the interests of\\r\\nboth nations were alike promoted, by having a few feeble colonies\\r\\nelevated into the rich and flourishing republic of the United States.\\r\\nThus the war of the American revolution must be pronounced to have\\r\\nbeen, on the part of England, which forced it, one of the most\\r\\ndisastrous and senseless of those blunders which have ever accompanied\\r\\nthe progress of our race.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 38: Contemplate the still greater blunder of our civil war.\\r\\nIt was forced upon the nation by the slave traders, that they might\\r\\n_perpetuate slavery_. And now after the infliction of woes which no\\r\\nfinite imagination can gauge, these very slave-holders declare with\\r\\none voice, that nothing would induce them to _reinstate the execrable\\r\\ninstitution_. How much misery would have been averted, and what a\\r\\ncomparative paradise would our southern country now have been, if\\r\\nbefore, instead of after the war, the oppressed had been allowed to go\\r\\nfree!]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XV.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Life\\'s Closing Scenes._\\r\\n\\r\\n     Advice to Thomas Paine--Scenes at Passy--Journey to the\\r\\n     Coast--Return to America--Elected Governor of\\r\\n     Pennsylvania--Attends the Constitutional\\r\\n     Convention--Proposes prayers--Remarkable speech--Letter to\\r\\n     Dr. Stiles--Christ on the Cross--Last sickness and death.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout this time some one, knowing Dr. Franklin\\'s deistical views,\\r\\npresented, for his opinion, a treatise denouncing the idea, that there\\r\\nwas any God, who manifested any interest in the affairs of men, that\\r\\nthere was any _Particular Providence_. Though Franklin did not accept\\r\\nthe idea, that Jesus Christ was a divine messenger, and that the Bible\\r\\nwas a supernatural revelation of God\\'s will, he certainly did not, in\\r\\nhis latter years, deny that there was a God, who superintended the\\r\\naffairs of this world, and whom it was proper to worship. It is\\r\\ngenerally supposed that Thomas Paine was the author of this treatise,\\r\\nand that it was a portion of his Age of Reason. Franklin, in his\\r\\nmemorable reply, wrote,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I have read your manuscript with some attention. By the\\r\\n     argument it contains against a particular Providence, though\\r\\n     you allow a _general_ Providence, you strike at the\\r\\n     foundations of all religion. For without the belief of a\\r\\n     providence that takes cognizance of, guards and guides and\\r\\n     may favor particular persons, there is no motive to worship\\r\\n     a deity, to fear his displeasure or to pray for his\\r\\n     protection. I will not enter into any discussion of your\\r\\n     principles, though you seem to desire it. At present I shall\\r\\n     only give you my opinion that, though your reasonings are\\r\\n     subtile, and may prevail with some readers, you will not\\r\\n     succeed so as to change the general sentiments of mankind on\\r\\n     that subject; and the consequence of printing this piece\\r\\n     will be, a great deal of odium drawn upon yourself; mischief\\r\\n     to you and no benefit to others. He that spits against the\\r\\n     wind, spits in his own face.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I would advise you, therefore, not to attempt unchaining\\r\\n     the tiger, but to burn this piece before it is seen by any\\r\\n     other person; whereby you will save yourself a great deal of\\r\\n     mortification, by the enemies it may raise against you, and\\r\\n     perhaps a good deal of regret and repentance. If men are so\\r\\n     wicked _with religion_, what would they be if _without it_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin testifies to the remarkable courtesy which characterized all\\r\\nthe movements of the French minister, during these protracted and\\r\\ndelicate negotiations. The definitive treaty was signed on the 3d of\\r\\nSeptember, 1783. It was unanimously ratified by Congress on the 14th\\r\\nof January, 1784. The king of England gave it his signature on the 9th\\r\\nof April. Thus two years and three months passed between the beginning\\r\\nof negotiations and the conclusion of the treaty of peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the termination of the war crowds of Englishmen flocked to Paris.\\r\\nFranklin was then recognized as incomparably the most illustrious man\\r\\non the continent of Europe. His apartments were ever thronged with men\\r\\nof highest note from all the nations. He was then seventy-eight years\\r\\nof age, suffering severely from the gout and the gravel. He often\\r\\nreceived his guests in his bed chamber, sitting in his night gown,\\r\\nwrapped in flannels, and reclining on a pillow. Yet his mind retained\\r\\nall its brilliance. All who saw him were charmed. Mr. Baynes wrote,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Of all the celebrated persons whom, in my life, I have\\r\\n     chanced to see, Dr. Franklin, both from his appearance and\\r\\n     his conversation, seemed to me the most remarkable. His\\r\\n     venerable, patriarchal appearance, the simplicity of his\\r\\n     manner and language, and the novelty of his observations\\r\\n     impressed me as one of the most extraordinary men that ever\\r\\n     existed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this time he wrote several essays, which are esteemed among the\\r\\nbest of his writings. He was awaiting permission from Congress to\\r\\nreturn to America. His son, the governor, who was receiving a pension\\r\\nof eight hundred pounds from the British Government, came over from\\r\\nEngland to his illustrious father, soliciting reconciliation. This was\\r\\nafter the separation of many years. Franklin responded kindly, though\\r\\nhe said that nothing had ever wounded him so keenly as to find himself\\r\\ndeserted in his old age, by his only son; and to see him taking up\\r\\narms against a cause, upon which he had staked life, fortune and\\r\\nhonor.\\r\\n\\r\\nA year passed before Franklin was recalled. He was then so feeble that\\r\\nhe could not walk, and could only ride in a litter. Mr. Jefferson\\r\\nsucceeded him. Upon his arrival in Paris, the Count de Vergennes said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You replace Dr. Franklin, I understand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No!\" Mr. Jefferson replied, \"I _succeed_ him. No man can _replace_\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin\\'s infirmities were such that he could not call upon the king\\r\\nor the minister for an audience of leave. He, however, wrote to Count\\r\\nde Vergennes a very grateful and affectionate letter, in which he\\r\\nsaid,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"May I beg the favor of you, sir, to express respectfully\\r\\n     for me, to his majesty, the deep sense I have of all the\\r\\n     inestimable benefits his goodness has conferred on my\\r\\n     country; a sentiment that it will be the business of the\\r\\n     little remainder of the life now left me, to impress equally\\r\\n     on the minds of all my countrymen. My sincere prayers are\\r\\n     that God may shower down his blessings on the king, the\\r\\n     queen, their children and all the royal family, to the\\r\\n     latest generations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reply was equally cordial and affectionate. As a parting gift the\\r\\nking sent Franklin his portrait, decorated with four hundred and eight\\r\\ndiamonds. Its estimated value was ten thousand dollars.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 12th of July, 1785, Franklin, accompanied by many admiring\\r\\nfriends in carriages, commenced his slow journey in a litter, from\\r\\nPassy to Havre. It was four o\\'clock in the afternoon. The litter was\\r\\nborne by two mules. The first night they stopped at St. Germain.\\r\\nThence the journey was continued at the rate of about eighteen miles a\\r\\nday. The motion of the litter did not seriously incommode him. The\\r\\ncardinal of Rochefoucald, archbishop of Rouen, insisted upon his\\r\\naccepting the hospitality of his mansion at Gaillon. It was a superb\\r\\nchateau, commanding a magnificent prospect, with galleries crowded\\r\\nwith paintings and the most valuable works of art.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The cardinal,\" writes Franklin, \"is much respected, and\\r\\n     beloved by the people of this country; bearing in all\\r\\n     respects, a most excellent character.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThough entreated to prolong his visit, Franklin resumed his journey at\\r\\nan early hour the next morning. At Rouen he was again received with\\r\\nthe most flattering attentions. The _elite_ of the city gave a very\\r\\nbrilliant supper in his honor. Thus journeying in a truly triumphant\\r\\nmarch, Franklin reached Havre on the 18th of July. After a delay of\\r\\nthree days he crossed the channel to Southampton. His old friends came\\r\\nin crowds, and from great distances, to see him. Even the British\\r\\ngovernment had the courtesy to send an order exempting his effects\\r\\nfrom custom-house duties.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will be remembered that Franklin was a remarkable swimmer. There\\r\\nare some human bodies much more buoyant than others. He records the\\r\\nsingular fact that, taking a warm, salt water bath here, he fell\\r\\nasleep floating on his back, and did not awake for an hour. \"This,\" he\\r\\nwrites, \"is a thing which I never did before, and would hardly have\\r\\nthought possible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 28th of July, 1785, the ship spread her sails. The voyage\\r\\nlasted seven weeks. This extraordinary man, then seventy-nine years of\\r\\nage, wrote, on the passage, three essays, which are estimated among\\r\\nthe most useful and able of any which emanated from his pen.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 13th of September the ship entered Delaware Bay, and the next\\r\\nmorning cast anchor opposite Philadelphia. He wrote,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"My son-in-law came with a boat for us. We landed at Market\\r\\n     street wharf, where we were received by a crowd of people\\r\\n     with huzzahs, and accompanied with acclamations, quite to my\\r\\n     door. Found my family well. God be praised and thanked for\\r\\n     all his mercies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Assembly was in session, and immediately voted him a\\r\\ncongratulatory address. Washington also wrote to him a letter of\\r\\ncordial welcome. The long sea voyage proved very beneficial to his\\r\\nhealth. He was immediately elected to the Supreme Executive, and was\\r\\nchosen chairman of that body. It is evident that he was gratified by\\r\\nthis token of popular regard. He wrote to a friend,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I had not firmness enough to resist the unanimous desire of\\r\\n     my country folk; and I find myself harnessed again in their\\r\\n     service for another year. They engrossed the prime of my\\r\\n     life. They have eaten my flesh and seem resolved now to pick\\r\\n     my bones.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after he was elected President, or as we should now say, Governor\\r\\nof Pennsylvania. The vote rested with the Executive Council and the\\r\\nAssembly, seventy-seven in all. He received seventy-six votes.\\r\\nNotwithstanding the ravages of war, peace came with her usual\\r\\nblessings in her hand. The Tory journals of England, were presenting\\r\\ndeplorable views of the ruin of the country since deprived of the\\r\\nbeneficial government of the British cabinet. Franklin wrote to his\\r\\nold friend, David Hartley,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Your newspapers are filled with accounts of distresses and\\r\\n     miseries, that these states are plunged into, since their\\r\\n     separation from Britain. You may believe me when I tell you\\r\\n     that there is no truth in those accounts. I find all\\r\\n     property in land and houses, augmented vastly in value; that\\r\\n     of houses in town at least four-fold. The crops have been\\r\\n     plentiful; and yet the produce sells high, to the great\\r\\n     profit of the farmer. Working people have plenty of employ,\\r\\n     and high pay for their labor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were many imperfections attending the old Confederacy. In the\\r\\nyear 1787, a convention met in Philadelphia, to frame a new\\r\\nconstitution. There was strong opposition to this movement. Washington\\r\\nand Franklin were both delegates. Washington took the chair. The good\\r\\nnature and wisdom of Franklin ruled the house. The convention met in\\r\\nthe State House. Franklin, eighty-one years of age, was regularly in\\r\\nhis seat, five hours a day, for four months. He was thoroughly\\r\\ndemocratic in his views, and opposed every measure which had any\\r\\ntendency to extend aristocratic privilege. He had seen that the\\r\\nBritish government was in the hands of the nobles. And silent, as\\r\\nprudence rendered it necessary for him to be, in reference to the\\r\\narbitrary government of France, he could not but see that the\\r\\npeasantry were subject to the most intolerable abuses. This led him to\\r\\ndetest a monarchy, and to do every thing in his power to place the\\r\\ngovernment of this country in the hands of the people.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch time was occupied in deciding upon the terms of union between the\\r\\nsmaller and the larger States. It will be remembered that this was the\\r\\nsubject of very excited debates in the convention of 1776. The\\r\\ndiscussion was earnest, often acrimonious. Such bitterness of feeling\\r\\nwas engendered that, for some time it was feared that no union could\\r\\nbe effected.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is evident that Franklin, as he approached the grave, became more\\r\\ndevout, and that he lost all confidence in the powers of philosophical\\r\\nspeculations to reform or regenerate fallen man. He saw that the\\r\\ninterposition of a divine power was needed to allay the intense\\r\\nexcitement in the convention, and to lead the impassioned members to\\r\\nact under the conviction that they were responsible to God. On the\\r\\n28th of June, this venerable, patriarchal man offered the following\\r\\nmemorable resolve:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Resolved, That henceforth prayers, imploring the assistance\\r\\n     of Heaven, and its blessings on our deliberations, be held\\r\\n     in the Assembly every morning before we proceed to business;\\r\\n     and that one or more of the clergy of this city be requested\\r\\n     to officiate in that service.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe speech which accompanied this motion will forever be conspicuous\\r\\nin our annals. He said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. President! The small progress we have made, after four or five\\r\\nweeks close attendence and continual reasonings with each other; our\\r\\ndifferent sentiments on almost every question, is, methinks, a\\r\\nmelancholy proof of the imperfection of the human understanding.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In this situation of this Assembly groping, as it were, in the dark,\\r\\nto find political truth, and scarce able to distinguish it when\\r\\npresented to us, how has it happened, sir, that we have not yet\\r\\nhitherto once thought of humbly applying to the Father of Lights to\\r\\nilluminate our understandings?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the beginning of the contest with Britain, when we were sensible\\r\\nof danger, we had daily prayers, in this room, for divine protection!\\r\\nOur prayers, sir, were heard, and they were graciously answered. All\\r\\nof us, who were engaged in the struggle, must have observed frequent\\r\\ninstances of a superintending Providence in our favor. To that kind\\r\\nProvidence we owe this happy opportunity of consulting, in peace, on\\r\\nthe means of establishing our future national felicity. And have we\\r\\nnow forgotten that powerful friend? or do we imagine that we no\\r\\nlonger need his assistance?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have lived, sir, a long time. And the longer I live, the more\\r\\nconvincing proofs I see of this truth; _That God governs in the\\r\\naffairs of men_. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without\\r\\nhis notice, is it probable that an Empire can rise without his aid?\\r\\nWe have been assured, sir, in the Sacred Writings, that \\'except the\\r\\nLord build the house, they labor in vain that build it.\\' I firmly\\r\\nbelieve this. And I also believe that, without His concurring aid, we\\r\\nshall succeed in this political building, no better than the building\\r\\nof Babel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is almost incomprehensible that, under the influence of such an\\r\\nappeal, the great majority of the Assembly should have voted against\\r\\nseeking divine aid. In a note appended to this speech, Franklin\\r\\nwrites,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The convention, except three or four persons, thought\\r\\n     prayers unnecessary.\"[39]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 39: Mr. Parton undoubtedly suggested the true reason for\\r\\nthis strange refusal to seek divine guidance. He writes,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I think it not improbable that the cause of this opposition\\r\\n     to a proposal so seldom negatived in the United States, was\\r\\n     the prevalence in the Convention of the French tone of\\r\\n     feeling with regard to religious observances. If so, it was\\r\\n     the more remarkable to see the aged Franklin, who was a deist\\r\\n     at fifteen, and had just returned from France, coming back to\\r\\n     the sentiments of his ancestors.\"--_Parton\\'s Franklin_ Vol.\\r\\n     2, p. 575.]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe convention came to a triumphant close, early in September, 1787.\\r\\nBehind the speaker\\'s chair there was a picture of the Rising Sun.\\r\\nWhile the members were signing, Franklin turned to Mr. Madison, and\\r\\nsaid,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have often, in the course of the session, and the vicissitudes of\\r\\nmy hopes and fears as to its issue, looked at the picture behind the\\r\\nPresident, without being able to tell whether the sun were rising or\\r\\nsetting. But now at length, I have the happiness to know that it is a\\r\\nrising, not a setting sun.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWashington was universally revered. Franklin was both revered and\\r\\nloved. It was almost the universal feeling that, next to Washington,\\r\\nour nation was indebted to Franklin for its Independence. Franklin\\r\\noccupied, in the arduous field of diplomacy, the position which\\r\\nWashington occupied at the head of our armies. It was certain that\\r\\nFranklin had, at one period of his life, entirely renounced his belief\\r\\nin Christianity, as a divine revelation. His Christian friends,\\r\\nnumbering hundreds, encouraged by some of the utterances of his old\\r\\nage, were anxious to know if he had returned to the faith of his\\r\\nfathers. Dr. Ezra Stiles, President of Yale College, was a friend of\\r\\nFranklin\\'s of many years standing. When the revered patriot had\\r\\nreached his eighty-fifth year, Dr. Stiles wrote, soliciting his\\r\\nportrait for the college library. In this letter, he says,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I wish to know the opinion of my venerable friend,\\r\\n     concerning Jesus of Nazareth. He will not impute this to\\r\\n     impertinence; or improper curiosity in one, who, for so many\\r\\n     years, has continued to love, esteem and reverence his\\r\\n     abilities and literary character, with an ardor and\\r\\n     affection bordering on adoration.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat Dr. Stiles, and the community in general, wished to know was,\\r\\nwhether Dr. Franklin recognized the Divine, supernatural origin of\\r\\nChristianity. Franklin evaded the question. This evasion of course\\r\\nindicates that he did not recognize, in the religion of Jesus, the\\r\\nauthority of, \"Thus saith the Lord.\" But he wished to avoid wounding\\r\\nthe feelings of his Christian friends by this avowal. He wrote,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"This is my creed. I believe in God, the Creator of the\\r\\n     Universe; that he governs it by his Providence; that he\\r\\n     ought to be worshiped; that the most acceptable service we\\r\\n     render to him, is doing good to his other children; that the\\r\\n     soul of man is immortal, and will be treated with justice in\\r\\n     another life, respecting its conduct in this. These I take\\r\\n     to be fundamental points in all sound religion, and I regard\\r\\n     them as you do, in whatever sect I meet with them.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"As to Jesus of Nazareth, my opinion of whom you\\r\\n     particularly desire, I think his system of morals and his\\r\\n     religion, as he left them to us, the best the world ever\\r\\n     saw, or is like to see. But I apprehend it has received\\r\\n     various corrupting changes, and I have, with most of the\\r\\n     Dissenters in England, some doubts as to his Divinity;\\r\\n     though it is a question I do not dogmatize upon, having\\r\\n     never studied it. And I think it needless to busy myself\\r\\n     with it now, when I expect soon an opportunity of knowing\\r\\n     the truth with less trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I see however no harm in its being believed, if that belief\\r\\n     has the good consequence, as probably it has, of making his\\r\\n     doctrines more respected and observed; especially as I do\\r\\n     not perceive that the Supreme takes it amiss, by\\r\\n     distinguishing the unbelievers in his government of this\\r\\n     world, with any peculiar marks of his displeasure. I shall\\r\\n     only add respecting myself, that, having experienced the\\r\\n     goodness of that Being, in conducting me prosperously\\r\\n     through a long life, I have no doubt of its continuance in\\r\\n     the next, though without the smallest conceit of meriting\\r\\n     such goodness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then adds the following suggestive postscript. \"I confide that you\\r\\nwill not expose me to criticism and censures, by publishing any part\\r\\nof this communication to you. I have ever let others enjoy their\\r\\nreligious sentiments, without reflecting on them, for those that\\r\\nappeared to me unsupportable, or even absurd. All sects here, and we\\r\\nhave a great variety, have experienced my good will, in assisting them\\r\\nwith subscriptions for the building their new places of worship. And,\\r\\nas I have never opposed any of their doctrines, I hope to go out of\\r\\nthe world in peace with them all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of his time, in these hours of sickness, he employed in writing\\r\\nhis Autobiography. The sufferings he endured were at times very\\r\\nsevere. But when he spoke of his approaching departure, it was with\\r\\ncomposure. At one time, when his daughter expressed the wish that he\\r\\nmight yet live many years, he replied \"I hope not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA clerical friend visited him, just as one of his paroxysms of pain\\r\\ncame on. As his friend in consequence was about to retire, he said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh no; don\\'t go away. These pains will soon be over. They are for my\\r\\ngood. And besides, what are the pains of a moment in comparison with\\r\\nthe pleasures of eternity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was, in one of the chambers of his house, a very beautiful\\r\\npainting of Christ on the Cross. He requested his nurse, a very worthy\\r\\nwoman, of the Friends\\' persuasion, to bring it down, and place it\\r\\ndirectly before him. The Rev. David Ritter, a great admirer of\\r\\nFranklin, called to see him. He had, however, but a few moments\\r\\nbefore, breathed his last. Sarah Humphries, the nurse, invited David\\r\\ninto the chamber, to view the remains. Mr. Ritter expressed surprise\\r\\nin seeing the picture of the Saviour on the cross occupying so\\r\\nconspicuous a position, saying, \"You know, Sarah, that many people\\r\\nthink that Dr. Franklin was not after this sort.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" she replied, \"but thee knows, David, that many make a great\\r\\nfuss about religion, who have very little. And many, who say but\\r\\nlittle, have a good deal. He was never satisfied, if a day passed away\\r\\nunless he had done some one a service.[40] Benjamin Franklin was one\\r\\nof that sort. I will tell thee how the picture came here. Many weeks\\r\\nago, as he lay, he beckoned me to him, and told me of this picture, up\\r\\nstairs, and begged I would bring it to him. I brought it. His face\\r\\nbrightened up, as he looked at it, and he said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Ay Sarah; there is a picture worth looking at. That is the picture\\r\\nof him who came into the world to teach men to love one another.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After looking at it wistfully for some time, he said, \\'Sarah, set\\r\\nthis picture up over the mantel-piece, right before me as I lie. I\\r\\nlike to look at it.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I fixed it up he looked at it very much; and indeed died with\\r\\nhis eyes fixed upon it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 40: This reminds us of the exclamation of the Emperor Titus,\\r\\nwho, at the close of a day in which he could not perceive that he had\\r\\ndone any good, exclaimed, sadly, \"Perdidi Diem.\" _I have lost a day._\\r\\nBeautifully has the sentiment been expressed in the words, which it\\r\\nwould be well for all to treasure up,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Count that day lost, whose low descending sun,\\r\\n     Views at thy hand no worthy action done.\"]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever deeply Franklin, in these dying hours may have pondered the\\r\\nsublimities of Immortality--the Resurrection--the Judgment Throne--the\\r\\nFinal Verdict--Heaven--Hell,--he was very reticent respecting those\\r\\nthemes. We certainly see none of the triumph of Paul, and of\\r\\nthousands of others, who have in varied language, expressed the\\r\\nsentiment that,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Jesus can make a dying bed\\r\\n     Feel soft as downy pillows are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA few hours before his death, as some one urged him to change his\\r\\nposition, that he might breathe easier he replied, \"a dying man can do\\r\\nnothing easy.\" These were his last words. He then sank into a\\r\\nlethargy, from which he passed into that sleep which has no earthly\\r\\nwaking. It was eleven o\\'clock at night, April 17, 1790. He had lived\\r\\neighty-four years, three months and eleven days.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut no candid and charitable reader can peruse this narrative,\\r\\nwithout the admission that Benjamin Franklin, notwithstanding his\\r\\nimperfections, was one of the wisest and best of all the fallen\\r\\nchildren of Adam. From his dying hour to the present day his memory\\r\\nhas been justly cherished with reverence and affection, throughout the\\r\\ncivilized world. And there is no fear that this verdict will ever be\\r\\nreversed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTRANSCRIBER\\'S NOTE:\\r\\n\\r\\nMinor changes have been made to correct obvious typesetters\\' errors;\\r\\notherwise, every effort has been made to remain true to the author\\'s\\r\\nwords and intent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Benjamin Franklin, A Picture of the\\r\\nStruggles of Our Infant Nation One Hundred Years Ago, by John S.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\r\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\r\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States.

maternal guardian within the year franklin married abiah folger nantucket she was the youngest daughter peter folger man illustrious for many virtues and whom has been well said that was worthy the grandfather benjamin franklin she proved noble woman and was all that either husband children could wish for ten children were the fruit this union benjamin was born the sixth january was born the morning sabbath day his father then resided directly opposite the old south church milk street the same day the babe whose renown was then little imagined would subsequently fill the civilized world was wrapped blankets and carried his father across the street through the wintry air the old south church where was baptized the rev willard was named benjamin after much beloved uncle then residing england this uncle was man some property decided literary tastes and the simple fervent piety which characterized the best people those days took ever increasing interest benjamin eventually came over this country and exerted powerful influence moulding the character his nephew whose brilliant intellect appreciated soon after the birth benjamin his father removed humble but comfortable dwelling the corner hanover and union streets here passed the remainder his days when franklin had attained the age five years terrible conflagration took place since known the great boston fire just the cold blasts winter began sweep the streets this great calamity occurred the whole heart the thriving little town was laid ashes over hundred families found themselves destitution the streets incident took place when franklin was about seven years age which left indelible impression upon his mind that cannot omitted any faithful record his life gave the following account the event his autobiography written after the lapse sixty six years friends holiday filled pockets with coppers went directly shop where they sold toys for children and being charmed with the sound whistle that met the way the hands another boy voluntarily gave all money for one then came home and went whistling all over the house much pleased with whistle but disturbing all the family brothers and sisters and cousins understanding the bargain had made told that had given four times much for was worth put mind what good things might have bought with the rest the money and laughed much for folly that cried with vexation and the reflection gave more chagrin than the whistle gave pleasure this story published franklin with his keen practical reflections has become household word all the families england and america and has been translated into nearly all the languages modern europe from early childhood franklin was celebrated for his physical beauty his athletic vigor and his imperturbable good nature his companions invariably recognized him their natural leader was respect what would called religious boy but many things had high sense honor there was marsh flooded high tides where the boys used fish for minnows much trampling had converted the spot into quagmire man was about build house near and had carted large quantity stones for the cellar franklin called the boys together and suggested that they should the evening take those stones and build wharf upon which they could stand with dry feet was done and under the skilful engineering the youthful franklin was quite scientifically done complaints and detection followed josiah franklin severely reproved benjamin for the dishonest act but does not appear that the conscience the precocious boy was much troubled argued very forcibly that the utility the measure proved its necessity the age eight years benjamin entered the boston grammar school his progress was very rapid and the close the year was the head his class the father had hoped give his promising boy liberal education but his large family and straitened circumstances rendered necessary for him abandon the plan the age ten years his school life was completed and was taken into his father shop run errands and attend the details candle making cutting wicks filling moulds and waiting upon customers could write good hand could read fluently could express himself with ease paper but all arithmetical studies was very backward there scarcely any sport which has such charm for boys swimming franklin excelled all his companions reported that his skill was wonderful and

expedients facilitate rapidity swimming formed two oval pallets much resembling those used painters about ten inches long and six broad hole was cut for the thumb and they were bound fast the palm the hand sandals somewhat similar construction were bound the soles the feet with these appliances franklin found that could swim more rapidly but his wrists soon became greatly fatigued the sandals also found little avail swimming the propelling stroke partly given the inside the feet and ankles and not entirely the soles the feet the vicinity boston there was pond mile wide franklin made large paper kite and when the wind blew strongly across the pond raised and entering the water and throwing himself upon his back was borne rapidly the opposite shore the motion says was exceedingly agreeable boy

age the population boston had increased about ten thousand incident recorded franklin this time which strikingly illustrates the peculiarity his mental structure and the want reverence with which gradually accustomed himself regard religious things his father habit the long graces which preceded each meal rather wearied the temper his son the precocious young skeptic with characteristic irreverence ventured say think father that you were say grace over the whole cask once for all would save time footnote works franklin temple franklin vol this was the remark boy but twelve years age though does not indicate very devout spirit certainly gives evidence intellect unusual acuteness franklin ever spoke his boyhood the very happy period remarkably happy life his peculiar temperament

lathrop wrote the boston manner the turn phrase and even tone voice and accent pronunciation all please and seem revive and refresh for two years benjamin continued assist his father the business soap and candle making was continually looking for opportunity escape the drudgery that employment and enter upon some more congenial business like most adventurous boys thought much the romance sea life elder brother had run away had gone sea and for years had not been heard from benjamin father became very anxious witnessed the discontent his son this anxiety was increased when elder brother married removed rhode island and set soap and candle establishment for himself this seemed benjamin rivet the chains which bound him home apparently his father could not spare him from the business thus seemed doomed spend the remainder his days employment which proved him increasingly uncongenial the judicious father apprehensive that his son might lured secretly embark for some distant voyage visited with his son all the varied workshops boston that might select that trade which him would seem most desirable benjamin examined all these workshops with intensest interest selected the employment cutler and entered upon the business for few days but that time boy who was about learn trade was apprenticed master premium for learning the business usually had pay about one hundred dollars then after series years during which worked for nothing was entitled for time receive journeyman wages but his father josiah franklin was unable settle satisfactorily the terms indenture and the cutlery trade was given have mentioned that franklin was one large family children the two marriages his father there were sixteen sons and daughters around the family hearth one the sons james had been sent london learn the trade printer returned boston and set business his own account when benjamin was eleven years age was decided bind benjamin this business reluctantly benjamin consented place himself such subordination his brother was however bound him for period nine years from twelve twenty one during the last year was receive journeyman wages the following extract from this form indenture apprenticeship which was common use the reign george the first will read with interest shall neither buy nor sell without his master license taverns inns ale houses shall not haunt cards

paid the said josiah franklin the father the receipt which hereby acknowledged the said apprentice the art printer which now useth shall teach and instruct cause taught and instructed the best way and manner that can finding and allowing unto the said apprentice meat drink washing lodging and all other necessaries during the said term benjamin devoted himself with great assiduity learn the trade printer the office which worked stood the corner franklin avenue and court street for three years franklin was thus employed apparently never seeking recreation and never having moment leisure save such could rescue from sleep from his meals there were that time several bookstores boston the eminent men that province had brought with them the new world literary and scientific tastes high order even then the axe the settler had been heard but short distance the primeval forests which still encircled all the large towns bears were not unfrequently shot from long wharf they swam from island island endeavored cross the solitary bay said that that time twenty bears were often shot week benjamin franklin inspired his love reading cultivated friendly relations with the clerks the bookstores from them borrowed interesting volumes which took home the evening with the utmost care and having spent most the night reading would return them early hour the morning before the master the shop had time miss them something the demeanor franklin attracted the attention merchant boston the name matthew adams invited him his library and loaned him books the lad uncle benjamin england who was very fond composing rhymes which called poetry sent many his effusions his favorite nephew and opened quite brisk correspondence with him thus benjamin soon became fluent rhymester and wrote sundry ballads which were sold the streets and became quite popular there was great demand that time for narratives the exploits pirates the doom murderers and wild love adventures said that one the boston publishers the sale ballads alone found very lucrative business benjamin who found very easy write doggerel verse wrote one ballad called the light house tragedy was graphic and what would called the present day sensational account shipwreck which the captain and his two daughters perished wrote another which was still more captivating and which all its main features was historically true was account the world renowned pirate edward teach usually called blackbeard the reader will find minute narrative the career that monster the volume this series pioneers and patriots entitled captain kidd the early american buccaneers one stanza has descended which said composed portion this ballad and which certainly fair specimen the popular style then vogue come all you jolly sailors you all stout and brave come hearken and tell you what happened the wave tis that bloody blackbeard going now for tell and how gallant maynard soon was sent hell with down down derry down this was indeed wretched stuff franklin afterwards admitted but remembered was then but boy fifteen having composed the ballad and set type and printed was then sent hawk through the streets this was certainly remarkable achievement for lad his years the eagerness with which both the ballads were seized the public must have greatly gratified the self esteem the young writer addison was bungler talk but every sentence from his pen was elegant once said carry loose change pocket but can draw for thousand pounds burke said goldsmith writes like angel but talks like poor poll franklin was means bungler his speech but was not fluent hesitated and was loss for words but whatever wrote had wonderful flow harmony the right word was always the right place doubtless had devoted much attention the acquirement conversational ease did skill writing would have been successful the one art the other from early life was his great ambition not merely fine but forcible writer did not seek splendor diction but that perspicuity that transparency expression which would convey the thought most directly the mind odd volume the spectator fell his way was charmed with the style selecting some interesting incident would read with the closest care would then close the book endeavoring retain the thought only without regard the expression then with pen hand would sit down and relate the anecdote the incident the most forceful and graphic words his vocabulary would afford this would correct and correct minutely attending the capitals and the punctuation until had made all respects perfect was his power then compared his narrative with that the spectator course usually found many faults which had committed but occasionally could not but admit had improved upon his original this encouraged him with the hope that long continued practice might become able writer the english language this practice continued for months varying many ways continued rhyme though admitted that there was little poetry his verse the exercise however thought useful giving him mastery language though franklin wrote ballads seemed mainly interested reading books the most elevated and instructive character locke essay the human understanding studied thoroughly the art thinking the messrs port royal engrossed all his energies but perhaps there was book that time which produced deep and abiding impression his mind the memorabilia socrates xenophon franklin was fond arguing was naturally disputatious with his keen intellect was pretty sure come off victor least his own judgment discussions with his associates but the socratic method argumentation different from that which had been accustomed indulge once secured his approval and admiration socrates was never guilty the discourtesy assailing opponent with flat contradiction positive assertion with politeness which never failed him and modesty demeanor which won the regard all others would lead his fellow disputant series questions assent the views which advocated franklin immediately commenced practicing upon this newly discovered art was remarkably successful and became one the most agreeable and beloved companions but ere long became satisfied the folly these disputations which each party struggles not for truth but for victory simply exercise intellectual gladiatorship which the man who has the most skill and muscle discomfits his antagonist jefferson warned his nephew avoid disputation says have never known during long life any persons engage dispute which they did not separate each more firmly convinced than before the correctness his own views franklin enjoyed marvellous health his digestive powers were perfect could live upon any thing and almost upon nothing without experiencing any inconvenience book advocating purely vegetable diet accidentally fell into his hands urged the pecuniary economy and the saving time adopting vegetarian diet eagerly adopted the views presented could safely had the author advocated raw onions and carrots the stomach franklin would have received them and assimilated them without any remonstrance succeeded inducing his brother relinquish one half his board and allow him board himself benjamin found that this way saved much time and much money handful raisins roll bread and glass water afforded him dinner this could dispose from five ten minutes and have the remainder the dinner hour for reading the hours the night were his own often sat late and rose early his soul all absorbed intellectual vigils there are two platforms morality some respects inseparably blended others quite distinctly separated from each other the one these platforms constitutes the low standard mere worldly morality says you must not kill you must not steal you must not lie you must not slander your neighbor you must not cheat him bargain but there another platform which not only includes all this but which introduces principles infinitely higher grade the platform enforced jesus christ essential life which shall pleasing our heavenly father our saviour says you must love god whom you live and move and have your being you must daily pray him with gratitude for the favors you receive the great conflict raging here below between sin and holiness your whole heart must yearn with the desire that god kingdom may come and that his will may done earth heaven imitating the example your saviour who was god manifest the flesh that his life might show men how live you must everything your power lead your neighbors and friends love god avoid everything thought word deed which you think will displeasing him and you must all your power prepare your heart for that world purity and love where the spirits the just are made perfect one can blind the fact that these principles are infinitely above the principles mere worldly morality they are not substitute for those principles but addition them the age sixteen franklin was disposed adopt the lower these creeds his rule life times affirming that was superior the teachings jesus christ while again there would the very clear and inconsistent avowal that this wicked world something more was needed than teachings which could plainly see seldom ever influenced lost and degraded man changed from saul tarsus paul the apostle one can understand the peculiar religious and moral character benjamin franklin without bearing mind these distinctions chapter developments character views the sabbath writings collins and shaftsbury the creed collins franklin sixteen the courant denunciations the paper franklin mode acquiring the art composition his success writer the editor prosecuted benjamin becomes editor and publisher jealousy his brother the runaway apprentice the voyage new york great disappointment eventful journey philadelphia gloomy prospects the dawn brighter days franklin was never scrupulous the observance the sabbath still though but occasionally attended church times very earnestly urged that duty upon his young friends not probable that the preaching heard those days was calculated interest him while child under the parental roof ordinarily accompanied his parents and seemed regard his duty now however with increasing sense independence very much preferred spend his precious hours his chamber reading books which engrossed his most intense interest unfortunately many treatises fell into his hands which unchristian sentiments were conveyed his mind men the highest intellectual character and whose writings were invested with the most fascinating charms eloquence robert boyle irish nobleman wealth and fervent piety had established oxford lectureship the object which was prove the truth the christian religion these lectures had found their way tracts the little library franklin father when but fifteen years age the boy read them with far keener relish than most school boys now read the flashy novels the day order refute the arguments the deists the lecturers were bound produce those arguments fairly and forcibly but this young boy piercing mind the arguments against christianity seemed stronger than those which were brought forward refute them thus the lad became not positive unbeliever but honest doubter now sought earnestly for other works upon that all important subject the two most important influential and popular writers that day were perhaps anthony collins and the earl shaftsbury these were both men fortune polished education and great rhetorical and argumentative skill their influence over young minds was greatly increased the courtesy and candor which pervaded all their writings they ever wrote like gentlemen addressing gentlemen and the views they urged were presented with the modesty men who were earnestly seeking for the truth the main attack both these men was directed against the miracles the bible was very evident that the divine authority the bible being overthrown the whole structure the christian religion and morality

accustomed vigor there were still fifty miles land travel before him ere could cross the forest covered plains new jersey burlington the banks the delaware which were seventeen miles above philadelphia there was neither railroad stage coach nor cart convey him through the wilderness indeed was thirty three years after this before the first line stages across new jersey was established there was rude path probably following ancient indian trail along which our solitary adventurer trudged foot rained but still benjamin found necessary having slender purse press regardless discomfort

woman burlington was the east side the river philadelphia was the west there was road between the two places the communication being the river only seemed impossible for benjamin toil that distance through the pathless tangled forest had but five shillings his pocket with the utmost economy that would not defray his expenses burlington for three days and leave sufficient sum pay his passage down the river his distress and perplexity our young philosopher whose renown for wisdom subsequently filled all christian lands turned back the poor aged woman whom had bought his gingerbread and solicited her advice the good old soul not insensible the charms the frank and manly looking boy with motherly tenderness insisted his going her own humble home gladly accepted the invitation the dinner consisted what called cheek franklin contributed pot beer walking out early the evening upon the banks the river found his great joy chance boat had come along bound philadelphia and containing many passengers eagerly franklin joined them and bidding adieu his kind entertainer was soon drifting slowly down the stream the night was dark there was wind and cheerful gleam from the white man cabin the indian wigwam met the eye was necessary resort rowing length little after midnight several the passengers insisted that they must have passed philadelphia without seeing and refused row any farther they therefore ran the boat into little creek built rousing fire for the night was damp and chill and ranging themselves around its genial warmth awaited the dawn the morning the light revealed them philadelphia but few miles below them was sunday morning nine clock the boat was made fast market street wharf and franklin with one silver dollar and one shilling copper coin his pocket stepped shore all his copper coin paid for his passage such was the introduction the future governor pennsylvania the realm over which was eventually preside governor and which became its most illustrious citizen was unquestionably dressed the peculiar and picturesque costume the times wore knee breeches buckskin and voluminous overcoat lined with pockets astonishing capacity which pockets were crammed with shirts and stockings low battered broad brimmed hat covered his clustering ringlets his coarse woolen stockings displayed advantage the admirably moulded calves his legs every article this costume was draggled shabby soiled and much tattered with indescribable feeling loneliness exhausted with the toilsome and sleepless night and with the cravings hunger sauntered into the town coming across baker shop stepped and called for three pennyworth bread philadelphia food was abundant and bread was cheap his surprise three long rolls were given him took one under each arm and his hunger the homeless boy walked along devouring the other philadelphia was then village widely spread out with surrounding vegetable gardens and containing population about seven thousand inhabitants benjamin walked listlessly along far fourth street chanced pass the house read whose very pretty daughter deborah was standing the front door she was eighteen years age and was much amused the comical appearance which the young man presented passed illustration not easy imagine these days the state society these early settlements hewn out from the forests the river banks and with the unexplored wilderness spreading out unimagined regions the interior night even from the houses the village the howling the wolves could heard they rushed after their prey bears and deers were shot abundance and indian bands painted and plumed were ever swarming through the streets franklin walked along devouring his rolls and returned the river for drink water such was his first breakfast philadelphia the boat was poor woman with her child franklin gave her the two remaining rolls which could not conveniently carry about with him not knowing what and led curiosity explore the town returned market street then one the chief avenues the city was little after ten clock the morning the street was crowded with well dressed people pressing along church there was one important edifice called the great meeting house the quakers stood the corner second and market streets franklin joined the crowd and took his seat with the vast assembly soon fell soundly asleep the hour passed away the congregation dispersed and benjamin was left still asleep some one then kindly awoke the tired traveler and again stepped out into the streets lonely where there was not individual whom knew and where almost without money could find refuge which could call home walked toward the river met young quaker whose countenance pleased him him inquired where could find respectable and comfortable lodging the friendly quaker led him tavern near chestnut street called the crooked billet franklin ordered frugal dinner threw himself upon the bed and slept till supper time and immediately after supper went bed and slept soundly till the morning had now been from home eleven days his money was nearly expended his clothes were worn and almost the only hope remaining was the very visionary one that bradford son might possibly have some employment for him early the morning carefully brushed his travel worn clothes his shoes his hat and making himself respectable appearance possible went the house the printer andrew bradford his surprise and gratification found the father there who had just arrived having traveled from new york philadelphia horseback benjamin met with courteous reception was invited breakfast was however greatly disappointed being informed that andrew bradford had just engaged another apprentice take the place the one who was lost bradford however stated that there was man the name keimer who had recently commenced the printing business the town and might have employment for him the old gentleman kindly offered the office with benjamin and introduce him keimer they found keimer very eccentric looking individual small office with old dilapidated press and with few worn out types asked the young man few questions put composing stick into his hands and professed himself satisfied with his work then told franklin that could find work for him immediately but thought ere long could employ him seems however that once benjamin went work repairing the dilapidated old press while continued board bradford paying for his board the work which performed chapter iii excursion england attention dress receives visit from gov keith his visit boston collins

his sisters had married captain robert holmes the captain vessel sailing between boston and the ports the delaware those piratical days when the master ship was compelled sail with guns loaded the muzzle and with sharpened sabres was deemed personage great importance weak ordinary man could discharge the responsibilities such post captain holmes influenced the love his wife wrote benjamin informing him the grief his departure had caused the family entreating him return and assuring him that all the past should forgotten benjamin his reply wrote with such precision and force logic that captain holmes became satisfied that was means much the wrong had supposed chanced that when the captain received this letter was company with sir william keith then the governor pennsylvania read the letter the governor sir william was charmed with its literary and rhetorical ability and could scarcely believe that the writer was but eighteen years age the philadelphia printers said are wretched ones keimer compound fool and rogue but this young man manifestly great promise and ought encouraged one day benjamin and his master were working together when they saw two well dressed gentlemen approaching they proved the governor pennsylvania sir william keith and franklin brother law captain holmes whom probably had never before seen keimer ran down stairs meet them supposing course that must the man who was entitled the honor their visit his surprise they inquired for his apprentice and went the stairs the printing office see him benjamin was quite overwhelmed the honors with which

deemed expedient throw the veil great secrecy over the enterprise which was contemplating engage the voyage was exceedingly tempestuous the vessel sprang leak for some time passengers and crew worked the pumps night and day but after being buffeted winds and waves for fourteen dreary days the little vessel cast anchor the harbor boston franklin had then been absent from home seven months his sudden appearance was great surprise all the members the numerous family not surprising that the young man elated his brilliant prospects assumed rather lordly airs his dress was new and quite elegant had purchased handsome watch which was not reluctant display had his pocket twenty five dollars silver coin franklin brother james from whom had run away was greatly annoyed the airs superiority assumed his old apprentice with cold and almost scornful eye scanned his person from head foot scarcely offering his hand greeting and soon coldly and silently returned his work but the imperial young man was not thus put down his former acquaintances gathered eagerly around him and listened with intensest interest the narrative his adventures glowing terms benjamin described his new home philadelphia drew out from his pocket handfuls silver which exhibited them and with quite lordly dignity gave his former fellow journeymen money the ale house for treat the candid reader will make some allowances for the conduct benjamin when remembers that but few months before had run away escape the cudgel his brother will also feel inclined make some allowance for james when informed that was adversity and struggling severely with pecuniary embarrassment the courant deprived the graphic pen franklin was rapidly losing its subscribers and soon became extinct benjamin father josiah who needed his own business every dollar the funds could raise silently and almost without remark read the letter sir william keith and listened attentively the glowing descriptions his son soon after

lot the drunken collins became his constant scourge franklin felt constrained lend his old friend money had been entrusted family friend vernon collect debt about fifty dollars this money was retain till called for but meet his own expenses and those his spendthrift companion began draw upon until all disappeared was then troubled with the apprehension that the money might demanded bitter were the quarrels which arose between him and john collins his standard morality which was perhaps not less elevated than that which the majority imperfect professing christians practice was certainly below that which the religion jesus christ enjoins had been true christian according the doctrines and precepts jesus would have escaped these accumulating sorrows illustration this breaking upon his friend vernon money and spending pronounces his autobiography have been the first great error his life though chanced that the money was not required until franklin was able pay yet for several months

franklin tried dissuade him from his folly but vain one occasion they all agreed attempt version the eighteenth psalm this sublime production inspired pen contains fifty verses imagery grand and sentiments beautiful perhaps can anywhere else found within the same compass any language certainly speaks well for the intellectual acumen these young men and for their devotional instincts that they should have selected noble theme their main object was improve themselves the command language and the power expression they could not have chosen subject more appropriate than the psalmist description the descent god earth bowed the heavens also and came down and darkness was under his feet and rode upon cherub and did fly yea did fly upon the wings the wind made darkness his secret

about the november that late hour the private secretary the governor called upon franklin and informed him that sir william would meet him newcastle where the vessel was cast anchor and would then and there deliver him all the important documents franklin went board the ship dropped down the broad and beautiful delaware whose banks were brilliant with foliage their richest autumnal brilliance about thirty two miles below philadelphia newcastle the great disappointment franklin the governor still did not appear however sent his secretary with profusion excuses and professing pressed with business the utmost importance promised send the letters the captain before the vessel would permitted sail franklin naturally buoyant and hopeful did not even then consider possible that the governor was intending deceive him neither was possible conceive any motive which would induce sir william betray him deceptive game length bag from the governor apparently filled with letters and dispatches was brought board and again the vessel unfurled her sails franklin with some solicitude asked for those which were directed him but captain annis all engrossed with the cares embarkation said that was too busy examine the bag that time but that they would their leisure the voyage select the letters the november the good ship the london hope pushed out from the delaware upon the broad atlantic know not

examined the letter bag but letter was found addressed him there were several however addressed other persons with franklin name upon the envelope they were his care one these was addressed the king printer and another stationer london the sanguine young man through all the dreary and protracted voyage clung the hope that all was right upon arriving london franklin hastened first the stationer and presented him with the letter saying him here letter from governor keith pennsylvania the stationer looked with surprise and said governor keith not know any such person then breaking the seal and looking the signature said very contemptuously riddlesden have lately found him complete rascal will have nothing with him nor receive any letters from him footnote both happen know well the stationer that riddlesden the attorney was very knave had half ruined miss read father persuading him bound for him his letter appeared there was secret scheme foot the prejudice hamilton that keith was concerned with riddlesden works franklin sparks vol saying thrust the letter back into franklin hand and turned away serve customer franklin was almost stunned with this intelligence immediately conferred with denham judicious friend whose acquaintance had made board the ship they ascertained that the infamous governor from motives which difficult comprehend had not furnished franklin with single document there was not bill credit single letter introduction commending the young adventurer people london denham then told him that one who knew keith had the slightest confidence his promises that the idea that would furnish him with any letters credit was preposterous since sir william had credit with any body and thus franklin found himself with his companion james ralph alone the great world london without any letters introduction without any prospect employment and almost without money the virtues franklin had exerted restraining influence upon the unprincipled ralph and franklin had not yet become acquainted with the true basis his character the two young men met together consult this dilemma and examine their finances appeared that ralph had scarcely one penny his pocket had intended hanger upon franklin whose ability take care himself and others had the greatest confidence franklin purse contained about fifty dollars again returned consult with denham very wisely advised franklin seek employment some the printing offices london encouraged him with the thought that thus with few months labor might not only pay his expenses but also lay sufficient sum defray his passage home franklin gradually perceived his dismay what old man the sea had got upon his shoulders the person james ralph the following his calm comment upon the atrocious conduct keith what shall think writes governor playing such pitiful tricks and imposing grossly upon poor ignorant boy was habit had acquired wished please every body and having little give gave expectations was otherwise ingenuous sensible man pretty good writer and good governor for the people though not for his constituents the proprietaries several our best laws were his planning and passed during his administration the entire absence anger this statement has won for franklin great commendation with his dependent ralph took humble lodgings little britain street ralph had remarkable powers

almost invariably the evening sought recreation with ralph the theatre safe infer that the best productions our best dramatists were those which would most interest the mind our young philosopher ralph was daily gaining increasing influence over his mind said that are prone love more ardently those upon whom confer favors than those from whom receive them these two young men the pleasures

his mind was such state reference the claims that christianity which certainly did not commend the mode life was living that excited not only antagonistic but even angry emotions thoroughly were his feelings aroused that wrote and published pamphlet thirty two pages refutation the theory wollaston franklin dedicated his work which was entitled dissertation liberty and necessity pleasure and pain james ralph fortunately the treatise has descended unmutilated commences with the observation have here given you present thoughts upon the general state things the universe the production was certainly very able one come from the pen young printer but nineteen years palmer while recognizing its ability pronounced its principles atrocious and demoralizing the production such work literary philosophical and religious probably the youngest companion the journeymen printers caused them all open their eyes with astonishment and was regarded once great man among them footnote this extraordinary document our young deist writes there said first mover who called god who all wise all good all powerful all good whatsoever doeth must good all wise whatever doeth must wise that there are things which give the name evil not denied such theft murder etc but these are not reality evils suppose anything exist done contrary the will the almighty suppose him not almighty there nothing done but god either does permits though creature may many actions which his fellow creatures will named evil yet can not act what will itself displeasing god will sum the argument thus when the creator first designed the universe either was his will that all should exist and the manner they are this time was his will that they should otherwise say was his will things should otherwise say that somewhat hath contradicted his will which impossible therefore must allow that all things exist now manner agreeable his will and consequence that all are equally good and therefore equally

religious restraint and taking advantage importance her attempted take some liberties with her another erratum which she repulsed with proper degree resentment she wrote ralph and acquainted him with conduct this occasioned breach between and when returned london let know considered all the obligations had been under annulled works franklin vol franklin does not conceal these foibles regarded them these sins christianity pronounces them declares this simply have been another the great errors his youth she informed ralph his conduct was enraged broke off all further communication with franklin and thirty five years passed away before they met again ralph goaded desperation gained wretched living various literary adventures writing for any body any side and for any price indeed eventually gained quite ephemeral reputation could express himself with vivacity and several quite prominent politicians sought the aid his pen franklin thus relieved from the support ralph soon after entered more extensive printing house lincoln inn fields though was exceedingly fond sparkling glass wine his convivial hours was too much philosopher stupefy his brain guzzling beer his habitual daily

from london chelsea distance four miles several his companions taught swim two lessons his celebrity was such that was urged open swimming school the life self indulgence was now living london was not such even his loose religious principles could approve had abandoned the faith his fathers and had adopted for his rule conduct the principle that was right yield any indulgences which his passions incited him became tired london and probably found necessary break away from the influences and associates with which had surrounded himself footnote one these days was surprise sent for great man

taught swimming and proposed gratify handsomely would teach them they were not yet come town and stay was uncertain could not undertake but from the incident thought likely that were remain england

voyage had decided return philadelphia and open extensive store offered franklin two hundred and fifty dollars year book keeper though this was less than the sum franklin was then earning compositor there were prospects his advancement this consideration addition his desire escape from london led him accept the offer was now twenty years age does not appear that had thus far formed any deliberate plan for his life work floated along the current events drifted him the twenty first july franklin embarked board the ship berkshire for philadelphia had been absent from america but little more than year and half during this time had not increased his fortune for had spent his money fast had earned after voyage eighty days the ship cast anchor before philadelphia that time ships were often from three seven months effecting the passage across the atlantic usual franklin kept diary punctually during his long voyage its pages were replete with pithy remarks wit and wisdom was very fond game checkers and that amusement beguiled many weary hours find the following striking comments upon the diversion his journal game much delight but requires clear head and undisturbed the persons playing they would play well ought not much regard the consequences the game for that diverts and withdraws the mind from the game itself and makes the player liable make many false open moves will venture lay down for infallible rule that two persons equal judgment play for considerable sum that loves money most shall lose his anxiety for the success the game confounds him courage almost requisite for the good conduct this game real battle for the player imagines himself opposed one that much his superior skill his mind intent the defensive part that advantage passes unobserved the governor the isle wight had died leaving the reputation having been one the most consummate scoundrels who ever exercised despotic power franklin his treatise upon liberty and necessity written but few months before had assumed that there was such thing good and evil that god ordered and controlled every event and that consequently every event was accordance with his will and alike pleasing his sight but now find the following record his journal which most readers will recognize inconsistent with the young philosopher theological opinions writes the death this governor appeared that was great villain and great politician there was crime damnable which would stick the execution his designs and yet had the art covering all thick that with almost all men general while lived passed for saint short believe impossible for man though has all the cunning devil live and die villain and yet conceal well carry the name honest fellow the grave with him but some one some accident other shall discover him truth and sincerity have certain distinguishing native lustre about them which cannot perfectly counterfeited they are like fire and flame that cannot painted should infer from some intimations franklin diary that was troubled some qualms conscience view his abandonment miss read and his irregular life london has left paper which stated that had never formed any regular plan for the control his conduct that was now about enter new life and that was resolved that henceforth would speak the truth industrious his business and speak ill man these were rather meagre resolutions for young man under these circumstances adopt soon after landing philadelphia franklin chanced meet sir william keith the streets the governor seemed much embarrassed and passed without speaking does not appear that the acquaintance was ever resumed the governor lived nearly twenty five years afterward dishonored and ruined man and died the extreme poverty poor miss read heart broken and deeming herself forever abandoned yielded the importunities her friends and married mechanic the name rogers proved thoroughly worthless fellow his unconcealed profligacy and unfaithfulness his wife compelled her

another wife franklin entered upon his duties clerk denham with his accustomed energy and skill carried into his new vocation all his intellectual sagacity and speedily won not only the confidence but the affection his employer lived with denham and being always disposed look upon the bright side everything even his own imperfections notwithstanding his infidelity miss read seems have been very happy and even jovial young man four months after franklin had entered upon his mercantile career both denham and franklin were seized with the pleurisy denham died franklin though brought near the grave recovered writes suffered great deal gave the point own mind and was the time rather disappointed when found myself recovering regretting some degree that must now sometime other have all that disagreeable work over again the death denham broke the establishment and franklin was thrown out employment keimer whose service had formerly been engaged again made him offer superintend printing office franklin accepted the proposition there were five inefficient hands whom franklin was expected transform into accomplished printers with these and few others organized literary club called the junto the leathern apron club nearly every member was mechanic the club met every friday evening and the wine cup stimulate conviviality passed freely among them there were twenty four questions which were every evening read which answers were returned any one who could answer them between each question was expected that each member would fill and empty his glass one would think that the wine must have been very weak the heads these young men very strong enable them quaff twenty four glasses unharmed give few the questions specimens their general character have you met with anything the author you last read has any citizen your knowledge failed and have you heard the cause what unhappy effects intemperance have you lately observed has any deserving stranger arrived town since your last meeting has anybody attacked your reputation lately there any difficulty which you would gladly have discussed this time debates declamation and the reading essays added the entertainment these gatherings stories were told and bacchanal songs sung man could tell better story and few men could sing better song than benjamin franklin one was deemed suitable member the club who would not contribute his full quota the entertainment instruction the questions proposed franklin for discussion developed the elevated intellectual region his thoughts were accustomed range give few specimens can any one particular form government suit all mankind should the aim philosophy eradicate the passions perfection attainable this life what general conduct life most suitable for men such circumstances most the members the junto are the junto was limited twelve members soon became popular that applications for admission became very frequent six months passed rapidly away when keimer who was exceedingly immoral and worthless man and was fast going ruin some fit drunkenness ungovernable irritation entered the office and assailed franklin with such abuse that took his hat and repaired his lodgings resolved never return franklin was twenty one years age had laid money was still but journeyman printer the draft which had received from vernon for fifty dollars had not yet been paid was exceedingly mortified when allowed himself reflect upon this delinquency which certainly approached dishonesty this emergence conferred with fellow journeyman the name hugh meredith whose father was gentleman considerable property meredith proposed that they should enter into partnership furnishing the funds and franklin the business capacity that time franklin remembering his narrow escape from the grave the pleurisy wrote his own epitaph which has been greatly celebrated has generally been admired but some more sensitive minds perceive tone which somewhat repulsive the body benjamin franklin printer like the cover old book its contents torn out and stripped its lettering and gilding lies here food for worms yet the work itself shall not lost for will believed appear once more new and more beautiful edition corrected and amended the author the excellencies franklin did not run the line exquisite sensibilities the early age fifteen began cast off the restraints the religion his father and mother nearly all his associates were what were called free thinkers could not blind their moral imperfections parton writes his old friend collins remembered was free thinker and collins had gone astray ralph was free thinker and ralph was great sinner keith was free thinker and keith was the greatest liar pennsylvania benjamin franklin was free thinker and how shamefully had behaved ralph mistress vernon and miss read whose young life had been blighted through him footnote parton life franklin vol franklin creed thus far consisted only negations had belief had only unbelief indeed seems have become quite ashamed his treatise upon liberty and necessity published london and felt constrained write refutation this strange young man his discontent looked over the religions the world could find one that met his views therefore deliberately and thoughtfully sat down form religion his own many such persons have appeared the lapse the ages and almost invariably they have announced their creeds with the words thus saith the lord but our young printer twenty two years made profession whatever any divine aid simply said thus saith thoughts one would think could not have much confidence those thoughts when remembered that this time was writing refutation the opinions which had published london but few months before footnote arguments perverted some others especially collins and ralph but each these having wronged greatly without the least compunction and recollecting keith conduct towards who was another free thinker and own towards vernon and miss read which times gave great trouble began suspect that this doctrine though might true was not very useful london pamphlet printed and which had for its motto whatever right and which from the attributes god his infinite wisdom goodness and power concluded that nothing could possibly wrong the world and that vice and virtue were empty distinctions such things existing appeared now not clever performance once thought and doubted whether some error had not insinuated itself unperceived into argument the year franklin wrote benjamin vaughn respecting this pamphlet there were only one hundred copies printed which gave few friends afterwards disliking the piece burnt the rest except one copy was not nineteen years age when was written wrote piece the other side the question which began with laying for its foundation that almost all men all ages and countries have times made use prayer thence reasoned that all things are ordained prayer must among the rest ordained but prayer can procure change things that are ordained praying must then useless and absurdity god would therefore not ordain praying everything else was ordained but praying exists therefore all other things are not ordained this manuscript was never printed the great uncertainty found metaphysical reasoning disgusted and quitted that kind reading and study for others more satisfactory autobiography the book which franklin thus prepared was entitled articles belief and acts religion his simple creed was that there was one supreme god who had created many minor gods that the supreme god was great that did not desire the worship man but was far above the minor gods are perhaps immortal and perhaps after the ages lapse they are changed others supplying their place each these subordinate gods has created for himself sun with its planetary system over which presides and from the inhabitants which expects adoration writes that particular wise and good god who the author and owner our system that propose for the object praise and adoration inferred that this god not above caring for pleased with our praise and offended when slight him then prepares invocation this god our solar system founded the style the psalms but immeasurably inferior most those sublime utterances the psalmist israel and still the sentiments breathed were ennobling their character they proved that franklin was vastly superior the thoughtless reckless deists who surrounded him and that his soul was reaching forth and yearning for higher and holier attainments this invocation the whole which cannot quote writes creator father believe that thou art good and that thou art pleased with the pleasure thy children praised thy name forever thy power thou hast made the glorious sun with his attending worlds thy wisdom thou hast formed all things thy wisdom thy power and thy goodness are everywhere clearly seen thou abhorrest thy creatures treachery and deceit malice revenge intemperance and every other hurtful vice but thou art lover justice and sincerity friendship and benevolence and every virtue thou art friend father and benefactor praised thy name god forever amen the prayer which followed doubtless giving utterance his most inward feelings beautiful inasmuch wrote reason our ignorance cannot certain that many things which often hear mentioned the petitions men the deity would prove real goods they were our possession and have reason hope and believe that the goodness heavenly father will not withhold from suitable share temporal blessings virtuous and holy life conciliate his favor and kindness therefore presume not ask such things but rather humbly and with sincere heart express earnest desire that would graciously assist continual endeavors and resolutions eschewing vice and embracing virtue which kind supplication will the same time remind solemn manner extensive duty then added the supplication that might preserved from atheism impiety and profaneness that might loyal his prince that might gracious those below him that might refrain from calumny and detraction that might sincere friendship just his dealings grateful his benefactors patient affliction that might have tenderness for the weak and that rejoicing the good others might become truly virtuous and magnanimous very evident that some unexplained circumstances had called the attention franklin very earnestly the subject religion wrote very much upon that theme and published new version the lord prayer and lecture upon providence and predestination however admits that very seldom attended any public worship adding had still opinion its propriety and its utility when rightly conducted and regularly paid annual subscription for the support the only presbyterian minister rumors soon reached franklin good father boston his son free thinking and wrote his son much alarm franklin reply said all that should expected from keep mind open conviction hear patiently and examine attentively whatever offered for that end and after all continue the same errors believe your usual charity will induce you rather pity and excuse than blame the meantime your care and concern for what very thankful for mother grieves that one her sons arian and another arminian what arminian arian cannot say that very well know the truth make such distinctions very little study think vital religion has always suffered when orthodoxy more regarded than virtue and the scriptures assure that the last day shall not examined what thought but what did franklin having revealed religion guide him and having foundation for his faith but the ever changing vagaries his own fantastic imagination could have belief day which had any certainty that would hold the same morrow was continually abandoning one after another the articles his fantastical creed and adopting others their place length settled down upon the following simple belief which with very considerable tenacity but without any attempt promulgate adhered for many years consisted the six following articles which give briefest language there one god governs the world ought worshipped doing good the service most acceptable him man immortal the future world the souls men will dealt with justly very evident that franklin had great confidence his theological opinions studiously avoided all writing upon the subject and far possible all conversation still with his keen sense humor could not refrain from occasionally plunging pretty sharp dagger thrust into the palpable imperfections the various and contending sects there was very little moral power the creed professed arrest young men glowing passions and exposed the most difficult temptations their downward career voice franklin was heard with potency calling upon those who were thronging the broad road lecture upon providence his companions the junto which was subsequently published and which reflects some considerable honor upon the earnestness his thoughts wrote especially discouraged when reflect that you are all intimate pot companions who have heard say thousand silly things conversation and therefore have not that laudable partiality and veneration

therefore will think yourself liberty assert dissert approve disapprove anything advance canvassing and sifting the private opinion one your acquaintance though was franklin assumption that his religion was one works and not faith still must admitted that his life was very inconsistent with those principles purity moral loveliness and good report which the gospel enjoins with his remarkable honesty mind strains which are constrained though with regret record writes that hard governed passion youth had hurried frequently into intrigues with low women that fell way which were attended with some expense and great inconvenience besides continual risk health distemper which all things dreaded though great luck escaped parton writes was perhaps owing his frequent delinquencies this way that his liturgy contains allusion vice which all others the most alluring youth franklin temperament was too sincere and logical man before his god and ask assistance against fault which had not fully resolved overcome and that immediately about year after the date his liturgy was born his illegitimate son william franklin who became governor new jersey laws were easily executed enacted benjamin

franklin had now reached the end life apprentice and journeyman with his friend meredith hired house the lower part market street the rent about one hundred and twenty dollars year large portion this

sure precursor success often franklin was found diligently employed until eleven clock night his industry and energy soon attracted attention gentleman living near the office said some his friends the industry that franklin superior anything ever saw the kind see him still work when home from the club and work again before his neighbors are out bed this statement produced such impression upon merchant who was present that called upon the young men and offered supply them with stationery credit franklin literary taste and his remarkable success writer led him ever cherish darling project the idea the establishing newspaper few months had quite deliberately formed his plan but some way keimer got wind and immediately issued prospectus for the establishment paper his own though was totally unqualified for the task editorship yet his project was quite hurtful the plans franklin very much annoyed the treachery which had revealed his plans keimer and perceiving that his paper was unpopular and heavy franklin very wisely decided establish his own reputation vivacious writer before entering upon the important undertaking issuing journal his own name there was small paper then published the city called the mercury commenced writing series very witty and satirical articles over the signature busy body the first number contained the following sentences intimations what was come probable that may displease great number your readers who will not very well like pay ten shillings year for being told their faults but most people delight censure when they themselves are not the object any are offended publicly exposing their private vices promise they shall have the satisfaction very little time seeing their good friends and neighbors the same circumstances these sparkling contributions franklin attracted much attention and created for him growing literary reputation the subject paper money which agitated our country was then being discussed pennsylvania with intense interest franklin wrote carefully studied pamphlet entitled modest inquiry into the nature and necessity paper currency this treatise written young printer but twenty three years upon one the most difficult questions finance displayed great ability warmly advocated paper currency his arguments however were such would not now probably exert much influence upon the public mind the main proposition endeavored sustain was that there was not sufficiency gold and silver pennsylvania for carrying the trade the province therefore argued that all branches industry must languish unless the currency were increased issue paper footnote this pamphlet may found sparks works franklin vol has been suggested that franklin might have been unconsciously influenced his views the fact that had been very successful printing paper money and that anticipated still more employment that line certain that franklin pamphlet exerted powerful influence the time and new issue paper currency was ordered franklin thought that the effect was highly conducive the prosperity the province and never swerved from the views which had earnestly and successfully urged his pamphlet franklin sun was rapidly rising keimer was rapidly sinking after publishing thirty nine numbers the universal instructor and the subscription list having dwindled ninety gladly sold the paper for trifle franklin and meredith the genius franklin was immediately displayed the improved literary character the paper and its mechanical execution the name was changed the pennsylvania gazette the first number issued him was oct the subject religion was almost entirely ignored franklin seems have become weary the darkness and the fogs through which his unillumined mind had been long painfully floundering without coming any results upon which could place reliance christianity generally treated with respect though could not refrain from occasionally giving sly thrust those imperfections christians which were palpable his observant mind and though never assailed that which was not inherently bad cannot denied that occasionally his keen sarcasms brought christianity itself into reproach were religion which produced better fruits perhaps not good religion all the business this young firm franklin and meredith viewed the light the grand printing enterprises the present day was indeed trivial the two young men did all the work themselves without even boy help them fact meredith who the best was poor workman and who fell into intemperate habits neglected his business frequented the ale houses and left all responsibility resting upon the efficient shoulders his partner franklin who endeavored perfect every thing undertook printed his paper admirably that said that there probably not journal now philadelphia which issued better style than the pennsylvania gazette for seven years franklin had been embarrassed the thought the fifty dollars which had received from vernon and which had not yet been repaid vernon wrote him very gentle intimation stating that would very convenient for him receive the money franklin returned contrite and magnanimous letter made attempt extenuate his fault promised immediately strain every nerve meet the debt and few months paid the whole principal and interest still the infant firm was struggling with adversity the partners had commenced operations with scarcely any capital excepting promises their outfit cost about thousand dollars meredith had been unfortunate business and found himself unable pay the second instalment promised five hundred dollars the stationers who furnished paper began uneasy for they could not but see that meredith was fast going ruin franklin was seldom the habit dwelling upon his misfortunes these dark hours wrote this distress two true friends whose kindness have never forgotten nor ever shall forget while can remember anything came separately unknown each other and without any application from offered each them advance all the money that should necessary take the whole business upon myself but they did not like continuing partnership with meredith who they said was often seen drunk the street playing low games ale houses much our discredit franklin generously was very reluctant throw aside meredith dissolute the young man had become could not forget that was the son man who had been his friend but after carefully pondering the question and seeing ruin stare him the face said one day meredith perhaps your father dissatisfied the part you have undertaken this affair ours and unwilling advance for you and what would for you that the case tell and will resign the whole you and about business meredith replied father has really been disappointed and really unable unwilling distress him further see this business unfit for was bred farmer and was folly come town and put myself thirty years age apprentice learn new trade many our welsh people are going settle north carolina where land cheap inclined with them and follow old employment you will take the debts the company upon you return father the hundred pounds has advanced pay little personal debts and give thirty pounds and new saddle will relinquish the partnership and leave the whole your hands these were hard terms but there was other way which franklin could escape from the embarrassments this untoward partnership accepted the proposal once borrowed the needful money his friends and became his own sole partner true prosperity now began attend his indomitable industry frugality and wisdom the advance the young man was necessarily slow but was sure well aware that his reputation with the community would invaluable him not only endeavored industrious but let seen his neighbors that left stone unturned accomplish his

orthodox clergy very heterodox his opinions probably suspicions his orthodoxy were enhanced from the fact that brought high testimonials eloquence from several the most prominent deists and free thinkers england was very fluent times very eloquent and franklin was charmed with the man and his doctrines boldly denouncing all creeds and all religious faith announced his creed and his faith that piety consists conduct alone crowds flocked hear him one day after preaching very eloquent sermon some one discovered that had stolen that sermon from james foster the most popular preacher london investigation took place which was compelled acknowledge that had stolen every one his sermons franklin writes this detection gave many our party disgust who accordingly abandoned his cause and occasioned our more speedy discomfiture the synod stuck him however rather approved his giving good sermons composed others than bad ones his own though the latter was the practice our common teachers had the young man said frankly rehearsing you the most eloquent sermons the most eloquent english divines one could have found any fault but for him assume that the sermons were his own and that personally was entitled the credit whatever power they exhibited was certainly practicing deception was gross violation franklin cardinal virtue sincerity was unworthy franklin his charitable regard for the offender gloss over the real criminality the offence year after franklin marriage son was born him whom gave the name francis folger franklin all accounts agree describing the child endowed with remarkable beauty and intelligence probably franklin never loved any being loved that child the year when this wonderful boy was but four years age was seized with the small pox and died even the

diverse character but franklin could not insensible the wonderful power this preacher promoting public morals and transforming the worst men into valuable citizens faithfully performing all the duties life surprising that this effect the gospel did not teach him that christianity the wisdom god and the power god salvation love was emphatically the message which whitefield with tearful eyes and throbbing heart proclaimed the wicked and the sorrowing god loved the world that gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth him should not perish but should have everlasting life christ came not into the world condemn the world but that the world through him might saved such were the themes which this apostolic preacher unfolded and which moved human hearts these new colonies seventeen hundred years ago they were moved the preaching our lord jesus christ and his disciple paul upon the plains asia whitefield taught that belief controlled conduct man sincerely believes will act franklin with his accustomed candor his autobiography wrote the following terms the effects the preaching this remarkable reformer the multitudes all sects and denominations that attended his sermons

through the town evening without hearing psalms sung different families every street whitefield leaving went preaching all the way through the colonies georgia the settlement that province had been lately begun but instead being made with hardy industrious husbandmen accustomed labor the only people fit for such enterprise was with families broken shop keepers and other insolvent debtors many indolent and idle habits taken out the jails who being set down the woods unqualified for clearing land and unable endure the hardships new settlement perished numbers leaving many helpless children unprovided for the sight their miserable situation inspired the benevolent heart whitefield with the idea building orphan house there which they might supported and educated returning northward preached this charity and made large collections did not disapprove the design but georgia was then destitute materials and workmen and was proposed send them from philadelphia great expense thought would have been better have built the house philadelphia and brought the children this advised but was resolute his first project rejected counsel and therefore refused contribute happened soon after attend one his sermons the course which perceived intended finish with collection and silently resolved should get nothing from had pocket handful copper money three four silver dollars and five pistoles gold about twenty five dollars proceeded began soften and concluded give the copper another stroke his oratory made ashamed that and determined give the silver and finished admirably that emptied pockets wholly into the collector dish gold and all some whitefield enemies affected suppose that would apply these collections his own private emolument but who was intimately acquainted with him being employed printing his sermons and journals never had the least suspicion his integrity but this day decidedly the opinion that was all his conduct perfectly honest man and methinks testimony ought have the more weight had religious connection used indeed sometimes pray for conversion but never had the satisfaction believing that his prayers were heard ours was friendship sincere both sides and lasted his death footnote autobiography franklin given sparks one time franklin wrote whitefield boston inviting him was about come philadelphia make his house his home the devout preacher replied you make this offer for christ sake you will not lose your reward promptly the philosopher rejected any such motive and rejoined not mistaken was not for christ sake invited you but for your own sake all the numerous letters essays and philosophical and religious disquisitions franklin seldom think find sentiment indicative any high appreciation the character jesus christ the debt gratitude owe him either for his teaching for his example franklin discarded all idea the atonement course could not express any gratitude for that which the christian the crowning act even divine love this saviour millions who cannot counted has proved even the comfort delusion temptation disappointment and death more precious than the power words declare one article from franklin newspaper

was the afternoon they were near one hundred men women and children and were lodged temporary cabins built the form square just without the town the evening hearing great noise among them the commissioners walked see what was the matter found that they had made great bonfire the middle the square that they were all drunk men and women quarreling and fighting their dark colored bodies half naked seen only the gloomy light the bonfire running after and beating one another with firebrands accompanied their horrid yellings formed scene the most resembling our ideas hell that could well imagined there was appeasing the tumult and returned our lodgings midnight number them came thundering our door demanding more rum which took notice the next morning they all seemed very much ashamed the disgraceful orgies which they had indulged there was law written their own hearts which told them that they had done wrong three chiefs were appointed call upon the commissioners with humble apology with downcast looks they confessed their fault and then with logic which more intelligent men sometimes use endeavored throw the blame upon god remarkable speech one them said the great spirit who made all things made everything for some use whatever use designed anything for that use should always put now when made rum said let this for the indians get drunk with and must the governor this time appointed franklin justice peace franklin says was much flattered these accumulating honors soon was elected seat one the legislators the assembly mainly through his influence hospital for the sick was established philadelphia though the measure encountered much opposition carried and the institution proved incalculable benefit the rev gilbert tennent solicited franklin aid raising money for building meeting house franklin had been continually engaged asking for money for various objects benevolence was afraid should become obnoxious his fellow citizens and declined tennent then requested him give him list the names those influential persons upon whom would well for him call every christian minister who reads this will appreciate the nature his embarrassment franklin says that thought would unbecoming him after having emptied the purses his friends send other beggars them with renewed importunities this request therefore declined tennent then urged him give him some advice franklin replied that will willingly the first place advise you apply all those who you know will something next those who you are uncertain whether they will give anything not and show them the list those who have given and lastly not neglect those who you are sure will give nothing for some them you may mistaken tennent laughed heartily and declared that would rigorously follow out this advice did his success was wonderful much larger sum was raised than had anticipated and soon capacious and beautiful meeting house rose arch street the streets philadelphia though laid out with great regularity were unpaved and wet weather were almost impassable quagmires franklin talking with his friends and urging the subject his paper length succeeded having sidewalk paved with stone upon one the most important streets gave great satisfaction but the rest the street not being paved the mud was thrown passing carriages upon and the city employed street cleaners the sidewalk soon ceased afford clean passage pedestrians franklin found industrious man who was willing sweep the pavement twice week carrying off the dirt from before all the doors for the sum sixpence month paid each house the philosophic franklin then having started this enterprise printed sheet paper the great advantages keeping the sidewalk clean and sent one these papers each house urged that much the soiling the interior the houses would thus avoided that attractive sidewalk would lure passengers the shops and that windy weather their goods would preserved from the dust after few days called person each house and shop see who would subscribe sixpence month was great success the cleanliness the pavement the important streets surrounding the market greatly delighted the people and prepared the way for carrying bill which franklin presented the assembly for paving and lighting all the important streets the city gentleman the name john clifton had placed lamp before his door this suggested the idea lamps were sent for from london globes were furnished they were expensive the smoke circulated the globe and obstructed the light they had wiped clean each day accidental stroke demolished the whole globe franklin suggested four flat panes one might broken and easily replaced crevices were left below admit current air and funnel draw off the smoke thus for long time the glass remained undimmed wherever franklin went carried with him this spirit improvement when london found the streets wretchedly dirty one morning found poor woman his door craven street sweeping the sidewalk with wretched broom her pallid and exhausted appearance touched the sympathies franklin asked who employed her she replied nobody poor and distress sweeps before gentlefolks doors and hopes they will give something franklin immediately engaged her sweep the whole street was nine clock the morning she was languid and debilitated that thought would take her nearly all day but three hours she came for her shilling franklin thought she could not have done her work faithfully sent his servant examine reported that the work was thoroughly done new problem rose before franklin this feeble woman could short time sweep such street strong man with suitable broom could certainly half the time therefore drew plan for cleaning the streets london and westminster which was placed the hands one the most influential the public spirited men london franklin apologizes for speaking his autobiography such trifles very truly says human felicity produced not much great pieces good fortune that seldom happen little advantages that occur every day thus you teach poor young man shave himself and keep his razor order you may contribute more the happiness his life than giving him thousand guineas this sum may soon spent the regret only remaining having foolishly consumed but the other case escapes the frequent vexation waiting for barbers and their sometimes dirty fingers offensive breath and dull razors shaves

franklin had been employed assistant the postmaster general simplifying and bringing regularity into his accounts upon the death the american postmaster franklin was appointed jointly with sir william hunter succeed him the appointment was made the postmaster general england the post office department had scarcely been self supporting had never paid anything the crown the salary offered the two postmasters was three thousand dollars year each they could save that sum from the profits the office franklin writes this variety improvements was necessary some these were inevitably first expensive that the first four years the office became above nine hundred pounds debt but soon after began repay and before was displaced freak the ministers which shall hereafter speak had brought yield three times much clear revenue the crown the post office ireland since that imprudent transaction they have received from not one farthing again there were menaces war insane and demoniac fill the world

would the woes with which these demoniac men could sweep our defenceless frontiers with the tomahawk and the scalping knife exterminating families burning villages and loading their pack horses with plunder forestall the french and turn these woes from our own frontier the humble homes the canadian emigrants the english government appointed commissioner visit the chiefs these tribes the year the all important council was held albany governor hamilton appointed four commissioners whom franklin was one act behalf pennsylvania they were furnished with rich gifts with which purchase the favor the indians was long and tedious journey from philadelphia albany franklin this journey was deeply impressed with the importance union the colonies for self defence therefore drew plan for such union several gentlemen the highest intelligence new york having examined gave their cordial approval accordingly laid before congress there were several other persons other colonies who were impressed deeply franklin with sense the importance such confederacy and they also sent their suggestions congress appointed committee one from each province consider the several plans the committee approved franklin plan and reported accordingly while the commissioners were conferring with the indians albany congress was engaged discussing the plans confederacy franklin plan was finally rejected did not meet the views either the assembly the british court and here see perhaps the germs the great conflict which soon culminated the cruel war the revolution the assembly objected the plan too aristocratic conferring too much power upon the crown the court emphatically rejected too democratic investing the people with too much power franklin ever affirmed that his plan was the true medium even the royalist governor pennsylvania warmly commended the compromise urged visiting boston was shown electric tube recently sent from england with this tube some very surprising electrical experiments were performed ushering new science which then but very little was known franklin became intensely interested the subject upon his return philadelphia devoted himself with great assiduity experimenting with electric tubes this time wrote friend never was before engaged any study that totally engrossed attention and time this has lately done for what with making experiments when can alone and repeating them friends and acquaintances who from the novelty the thing come continually crowds see them have little leisure for anything else this was during the winter franklin suggested

nearly all the philosophers europe and america the all important topics this exceedingly important document were the power points draw off electricity and also the similarity electricity and lightning therefore urged that metallic rods might attached buildings and ships which pushing their needle points above roofs and masts might draw the electric fire harmlessly from the clouds confesses that cannot imagine why the points should possess this curious power but urges that facts seem demonstrate one day for the entertainment his friends had made arrangements kill turkey with electric shock two large jars were heavily charged incautiously manipulating took the shock himself the following language describes the effect the flash was very great and the crack was loud pistol yet senses being

spring franklin tried his world renowned experiment with the kite june thunder cloud was rising all its majesty franklin accompanied his son repaired field secretly being afraid the ridicule the people here raised the kite made large silk handkerchief the top the perpendicular stick was pointed with sharp metallic rod the string was hemp with the exception the part held the hand which was

his knuckle again and again the key with similar result charged leyden jar with the fluid and both and his son took shock then drew his kite packed his apparatus and returned his laboratory probably the most exultant and happy man this wide world most the english and many the french philosophers were very unwilling believe that obscure american what they deemed the savage and uncultivated wilds the new world was outstripping them philosophical research they were unwilling acknowledge the reality his experiments but france where american would receive more impartial treatment three the most eminent philosophers count buffon dalibard and lor different places raised the apparatus franklin had recommended draw electricity from the clouds their success was unmistakable the results these experiments were proclaimed throughout europe franklin had now obtained renown one could deny that merited high position among the most eminent philosophers the experiments had suggested were tried scientists the philosophical circles every country europe both yale and harvard this country conferred upon him the honorary degree master arts and the royal society europe unanimous vote elected him member remitting the usual initiation fee five guineas and the annual charge two and half guineas the next year this society conferred upon him the copley medal for seven years franklin continued devote himself almost exclusively this science and became without doubt the most accomplished electrician the world the same time his mind was ever active devising new schemes for the welfare humanity the most trivial events would often suggest him measures conducive the most beneficial results said that franklin saw one day ditch the fragments basket yellow willow which some foreign commodity had been imported this country one the twigs had sprouted planted and became the parent all the yellow willows our country franklin was best loved where was best known and this was right for was ever

position respecting the christian religion with perfect frankness replied think that there are men high culture france with few exceptions who believe the divine origin christianity but there philanthropist who will say have been taught the horrors the french revolution that the masses the people can only restrained from violence the superstitious restraints which christianity presents therefore think that every man who gentleman will what can sustain the church and the clergy men culture and refinement are governed principles honor and they not need the superstitious motives christianity influence them may remark passing that this gentlemanly philosopher had abandoned his own wife and was then living with the wife another man not improbable that franklin looked upon the tumultuous and passion tossed young men philadelphia did not deem expedient say them the bible fable the sabbath more sacred than any other day the church merely human club without any divine authority marriage institution which not founded upon any decree which god has issued but one the expediency which each individual must judge for himself the sacraments baptism and the lord supper are mere human contrivances the preaching the gospel had better laid aside for literary and scientific disquisitions with the eye benevolent philosopher franklin have seen had watched the effect the preaching whitefield and had candidly acknowledged its power reforming society improbable that his heart felt that the preaching pure deism could ever secure such results wrote whitefield reply communication from him upon the christian faith the faith you mention certainly has its use the world not desire see diminished nor would endeavor lessen any man franklin had resolved decline all office that might devote himself his studies but his reputation for wisdom was such that found very difficult persevere this plan menaces war were continually arising the majority the members the assembly were quakers was small body consisting but forty delegates the quakers opposed every measure for public defence franklin have mentioned became justice the peace soon after was alderman and then took his seat the general assembly was bad speaker writes never eloquent subject much hesitation the choice words and yet generally carried point adds language which every young man should treasure his memory retained the habit expressing myself terms modest diffidence never using when advanced anything that might possibly disputed the words certainly undoubtedly any others that give the air positiveness opinion but rather conceive apprehend thing and appears should not think for such and such reasons imagine not mistaken this habit believe has been great advantage when have had occasion inculcate opinions and persuade men into measures that have been from time time proposing when franklin assumed the charge the post office the department was feeble and peculiar condition late the year the mail bag virginia was passed from planter planter each one was required forward promptly under the penalty forfeiting hogshead tobacco every man took from the bag what belonged his family and sent the rest the line post offices then extended from boston mass charleston was twenty years after this before any governmental mail penetrated the interior the year franklin visited every post office excepting that charleston his wisdom introduced reforms some which have continued the present day newspaper was charged nine pence year for distance fifty miles and eighteen pence for one hundred miles more the large towns penny post was established and all letters left remaining the office were advertised mail was conveyed from philadelphia new york once week summer and once two weeks winter franklin started mail leave each these cities three times week summer and twice winter generally required six weeks obtain answer from letter sent boston most the roads into the

gained strength the higher circles philadelphia some the more opulent families planned for series dancing entertainments during the winter was proposed among other rules that mechanic mechanic wife daughter should invited the rules were shown franklin glanced his eye over them and pithily remarked why these rules would exclude god almighty how inquired the manager because franklin replied the almighty all know the greatest mechanic the universe six days made all things the obnoxious article was stricken out the following incident narrated franklin illustrates very important principle political economy which those are apt ignore who denounce all the elegancies and luxuries life mrs franklin received some small favor from the captain little coaster which ran between cape may and philadelphia declined receive any remuneration for his trifling services mrs franklin learning that had pretty daughter sent her new fashioned philadelphia cap bonnet three years after the captain called again the house franklin very plain but intelligent farmer accompanied him the captain expressed his thanks mrs franklin for the gift she had sent his daughter and rather discourteously added but proved dear cap our congregation when daughter appeared with meeting was much admired that all the girls resolved get such caps from philadelphia and wife and computed that the whole could not have cost less than hundred pounds the farmer with far higher intelligence said this true but you not tell the whole story think the cap was nevertheless advantage was the first thing that put our girls upon knitting worsted mittens for sale philadelphia that they might have wherewithal buy caps and ribbons there and you know that that industry has continued and likely continue and increase much greater value and answer better purposes thus profitable exchange the industrious girls cape may had pretty bonnets and the girls philadelphia had warm mittens for seventy five years had been the constant design the british government drive the french from north america england claimed the whole country from the atlantic the pacific because her ships had first sailed along the atlantic coast was one the recognized laws nations that newly discovered region belonged the nation who had first raised upon its flag france admitting the claim england the atlantic coast asserted her right the great valleys the interior those the ohio and the mississippi because her boatmen had first discovered those magnificent rivers had explored them throughout and had established upon them her trading and military posts was recognized law nations that the power which discovered explored and took possession new river was the rightful possessor the valley which that river watered thus the conflict claims originated add the intensity the insane strife which caused amount blood and misery which tongue can tell religious bitterness was aroused and the french roman catholic was arrayed against the british protestant three wars bloody and woful had already ravaged this continent have before alluded the menace new war the year and franklin mission albany enlist the chiefs the six nations become allies the english have also alluded the plan which franklin drew this journey for the union the colonies and which was rejected the wisdom this plan was however subsequently developed the fact that was remarkably like that which eventually the colonies were bound together nation assuming that the english were right their claim for the whole continent franklin urged the eminently wise measure establishing strong colonies villages hundred families each the luxuriant banks the western rivers but the haughty british government would receive instructions from american provincials governor shirley boston showed franklin plan drawn england for conducting the war developed consummate ignorance the difficulties carrying war the pathless wilderness and also great disregard the political rights the american citizens according this document the british court was originate and execute all the measures for the conduct the war and the british parliament was assess whatever tax deemed expedient upon the american people defray the expenses the americans were have representation parliament and voice whatever deciding upon the sum which they were pay franklin examined the document carefully and returned with his written objections this remarkable paper anticipated the arguments which our most distinguished statesmen and logicians urged against the stamp act against taxation without representation brief extract from this important paper will give the reader some idea its character the colonists are englishmen the accident living colony deprives them right secured magna charta the people the colonies who are feel the immediate mischiefs invasion and conquest enemy the loss their estates lives and liberties are likely better judges the quantity forces necessary raised and maintained and supported and their own ability bear the expense than the parliament england great distance compelling the colonists pay money without their consent would rather like raising contributions enemy country than taxing englishmen for their own public benefit would treating them conquered people and not true british subjects length the brave but self conceited and haughty general braddock came with his army british regulars frenchmen indians and americans alike regarded with contempt his troops were rendezvoused fredericktown maryland bridle path led through the wilderness this place from philadelphia distance hundred and twenty miles intelligent american gentlemen were much alarmed the reckless and perilous measures which the ignorant british general declared his intention pursue became very angry with pennsylvanians because they were unwilling fall with his plans was said that his anger manifested more desire ravage pennsylvania than defeat the french the assembly philadelphia appointed commission consisting benjamin franklin and his son resolute insubordinate man thirty years and the governors new york and massachusetts visit the arrogant british officer and endeavor some way influence him wiser measures was the middle april beautiful season that climate swelling buds and opening leaves each the four gentlemen was attended servants was customary those days they were all finely mounted joyfully they rode along seeking entertainment each night the residence some planter courier was always sent forward announce their coming and the planter accompanied one two his servants would generally ride forward few miles meet them and escort them his hospitable home franklin was received gen braddock with the condescension with which that day english gentlemen were ever accustomed regard americans whatever name note the little army which was march upon fort duquesne was traverse the dreary and pathless ridges and ravines the alleghany mountains and force their way through tangled wilderness for distance several hundred miles during all this march they were hourly exposed attacked overpowering force french and indians the french could easily descend the ohio their boats from canada and nearly all the indians this vast interior were alliance with them braddock insisted upon encumbering his march with heavily laden wagons which were penetrate savage regions through which must every mile construct his road there was young american the camp the name george washington was man the highest rank and commanding influence having obtained much experience indian warfare modestly but warmly remonstrated against this folly not only feared but was fully assured that such measure would lead the inevitable destruction the army urged that pack horses only should employed and few them possible and that thus they should hurry along rapidly and compact mass they could but braddock was inexorable demanded his two hundred and fifty wagons and large train pack horses laden with sumptuous provisions for his officers the farmers maryland and virginia were reluctant expose the few wagons and teams they had such inevitable destruction neither had they any confidence that the british government would ever remunerate them case their loss four wheeled vehicles were very scarce the colonies there were many people who had never seen one the general after exhausting all his efforts could obtain but twenty four one day was giving vent his indignation franklin suggested that would probably much more easy obtain wagons the more densely settled parts pennsylvania braddock immediately urged him undertake the enterprise unwisely think consented with his son hastened pennsylvania and selected lancaster york and carlisle his centres operation whatever franklin undertook was pretty sure accomplish twenty days obtained one hundred and fifty four horse wagons and two hundred and fifty nine pack horses did not accomplish this feat however until had exhausted all the money which braddock had furnished him had spent over thousand dollars his own money and had given bonds for the safe return horses and wagons whose money value was estimated one hundred thousand dollars braddock was lavish his compliments franklin dined with him daily the idea seemed never have entered braddock mind that british regulars under his command could ever seriously annoyed bands french and indians said one day after taking fort duquesne shall niagara having taken that the season will permit shall proceed fort frontenac fort duquesne can hardly detain more than three four days franklin who was well aware that braddock was entering upon far more formidable campaign than anticipated ventured very modestly suggest sure sir you arrive well before duquesne with the fine troops well provided with artillery the fort though completely fortified and assisted with very strong garrison can probably make but short resistance the only danger apprehend obstruction your march ambuscades the indians who constant practice are dexterous laying and executing them and the slender line near four miles long which your army must make may expose attacked surprise its flanks and cut like thread into several pieces which from their distance cannot come time support each other braddock smiled derisively this ignorance benighted american these savages may indeed said formidable enemy your raw american militia but upon the king regular and disciplined troops impossible that they should make any impression colonel washington regarded the wagons and the long array pack horses many nuisances arresting the rapidity their march and inviting attacks which would impossible repel length the army was motion the progress was very slow franklin was continually forwarding supplies and even advanced between six and seven thousand dollars from his own purse expedite purchases part this never received back the attack upon braddock army and its terrible defeat soon came minute account the conflict given the life george washington one the volumes this series the teamsters cut the traces their horses mounted the swiftest and the frenzy their panic rushed for home the other horses and the wagons with their abounding supplies were left magnify the triumph the exultant indians disastrous was the campaign franklin obtained much credit for the efficient services had rendered war with all its horrors had now penetrated the beautiful region pennsylvania which had enjoyed eighty years peace through the christian philanthropy william penn nearly all the indians beyond the mountains were allies the french the news braddock defeat reached philadelphia about the middle july immediately violent conflict arose between the royalist governor morris and the colonial assembly the legislative body voted liberal taxes for the public defence but very justly was enacted that these taxes should assessed impartially upon all estates alike upon those the wealthy proprietaries well upon the few hundred acres which were owned the humble farmers the proprietaries consisting two the sons william penn revolted against this the governor appointed them their agent course united with them opposition for many weeks the conflict between the assembly and the governor agent the proprietaries raged fiercely under these circumstances military supplies could voted and the peril the community was very great franklin warmly espoused and eloquently advocated the claim the assembly during the months july and august the indians satiated with the vast plunder braddock camp made attempt cross the alleghanies predatory excursions against the more settled portions pennsylvania but september and october ushered scenes horror and carnage too awful depicted villages were laid ashes cottages were burned families tomahawked and scalped women and children carried into captivity and many poor creatures perished the stake the endurance all the tortures which savage ingenuity could devise and still the quakers adhering their principle non resistance refused contribute any money any way unite any military organization for self defence but candor must admitted that had the principles the quakers been adopted the british court this whole disastrous war might have been avoided was war invasion commenced the english they were determined force arms drive the french out the magnificent valleys beyond the mountains the conflict which ensued both parties enlisted all the savages they could allies will not england the judgment held responsible for this war and its woes rouse the quakers sense shame the bodies whole murdered family mutilated and gory were brought philadelphia and paraded through all its streets open wagon november the indians often led french officers were sweeping the frontier all directions killing burning destroying the antagonistic parties the assembly for time laid aside their quarrels and with the exception the quakers adopted vigorous military measures the quakers were generally the most opulent people the state not strange that the common people should reluctant volunteer defend the property the quakers since they refused either shoulder musket contribute dollar the pen franklin rendered wonderful service this crisis with his accustomed toleration could make allowance for the frailties conscience bound men wrote very witty pamphlet which was very widely read and produced powerful impression its character may inferred from the following brief quotation for part says coward but hang fight save the quakers that say replied you will not pump the sinking ship because will save the rats well yourselves the dialogue ends with the following admirable words friends the glory serving and saving others superior the advantage being served and secured let resolutely and generously unite our country cause which die the sweetest all deaths and may the god armies bless our honest endeavors the colonists pennsylvania now generally rushed arms there were the frontiers several flourishing moravian villages they were occupied peculiarly industrious and religious people the traveller through their quiet streets heard morning and evening the voice prayer ascending from many firesides and the melody christian hymns guadenhutton perhaps the most flourishing them was attacked the indians burned and the inhabitants all massacred carried into captivity terrible was the panic the other villages they were liable any day experience the same fate under these circumstances the governor raised five hundred and forty volunteers and placed them under the command franklin with the title general was lead them rapidly possible northampton county for the protection these people his son william was his aid camp proved efficient and valiant soldier was the middle december when this heroic little band commenced its march snow whitened the hills wintry gales swept the bleak plains and moaned through the forests the roads were almost impassable fierce storms often entirely arrested their march the wilderness was very thinly inhabited required the toil month for franklin force his way through these many obstructions the base his operations though was distant not more than ninety miles the troops moved very cautiously guard against ambush the philosopher franklin though had never received military education and was quite inexperienced military affairs was the last man drawn into such net that which the army braddock was destroyed franklin philosopher could appreciate the powerful influence religious motives upon the mind rev beatty was his chaplain whose worth character franklin appreciated before commencing their march all the troops were assembled for religious service after earnest exhortation fidelity and duty fervent prayer was offered the march was conducted with great regularity first scouts advanced semi circular line ranging the woods then came the advanced guard few hundred paces behind the centre followed with all the wagons and baggage then came the rear guard with scouts each flank and spies every hill upon reaching guadenhutton awful scene desolation and carnage met the eye the once happy village presented now but revolting expanse blackened ruins the mangled bodies the dead strewed the ground mutilated alike the savages and the howling wolves franklin ordered huts immediately reared protect his troops from the inclemency the weather man knew better than how make them comfortable and cheerful with the least expense fort was promptly constructed which called fort allen and which could easily repel any attack the indians might make unless they approached with formidable french artillery there were many indications that the indians large numbers were hovering around watching all their movements but the sagacity franklin baffled them they kept concealed without any attack the savages were very cautious men they would seldom engage battle unless they were sure victory trifling incident occurred this time worthy record illustrative the shrewdness general franklin the chaplain complained that the men were remiss attending prayers franklin suggested that though might not exactly consistent with the dignity the chaplain become himself the steward the rum still would order distributed immediately after prayers would probably have all the men gathering around him liked the thought franklin wrote under took the task and with the help few hands measure out the liquor executed satisfaction never were prayers more generally and more punctually attended that think this method preferable the punishment inflicted some military laws for non attendance divine worship bitter quarrels were renewed the assembly the presence franklin was indispensable allay the strife governor morris wrote entreating him immediately return philadelphia happened this time that col clapham new england soldier experience and high repute visited the camp guadenhutton franklin placed him command and warmly commending him the confidence the troops hurried home reached philadelphia the february after two months service the field universal applause greeted him several military companies philadelphia united regiment about twelve hundred men franklin was promptly elected their colonel which office accepted tracing the disasters war interesting observe how many those disasters are owing unpardonable folly some months after franklin departure cold bleak day november large part the garrison unmindful danger were skating like school boys the lehigh river the vigilant indians saw their opportunity like howling wolves they made rush upon the fort entered its open gates and killed captured all its inmates the skaters fled into the woods they were pursued some were killed captured some perished miserably cold and starvation probably few escaped the triumphant savages having plundered the fort and the dwellings all their contents applied the torch and again guadenhutton was reduced pile ashes the controversy which arose between the governor and the assembly became acrimonious the extreme the principles there contended for involved the very existence anything like american liberty for fifteen years the pen and voice franklin were influential this controversy probably did more than any other man prepare the colonists resist the despotism the british court and proclaim their independence the january king charles the second had conferred upon william penn twenty six million acres the best land the universe this land was the new world and received the name pennsylvania return for this grant penn agreed pay annually windsor castle two beaver skins and one fifth the gold and silver which the province might yield also promised govern the province conformity with the laws england could treat with the savages appoint ordinary magistrates and pardon petty crimes but could lay tax and impose law without consent the freemen the province represented the assembly this whole wide realm penn was the absolute proprietor refused sell single acre absolutely but all the sales reserved for himself what may called ground rent immense tracts were sold forty shillings about ten dollars for one hundred acres reserving rent one shilling for each hundred acres also reserved entirely himself various portions the territory which promised become the site important cities and villages all these rights descended the heirs william penn seventy four years passed away when the estate thus founded was estimated worth ten millions sterling and popular belief affirmed that produced revenue one hundred thousand pounds penn when died bequeathed the province his three sons john thomas and richard john gave double part one half pennsylvania john died and left his half thomas who thus became proprietor three fourths the province while richard held one fourth thus there were but two proprietors thomas and richard penn they were both weak men resided england were thoroughly imbued with tory principles and the consciousness their vast estates assumed lords and princes they ruled their province deputy governor his position was indeed sinecure the two proprietaries who appointed him could any time deprive him office the assembly could refuse vote his salary and displeased the king england might lose not only his office but his head the controversy which had arisen consequence these involvements between the proprietaries and the people engrossed universal attention during the four years between and the ravaged colony pennsylvania had raised the sum two hundred and eighteen thousand pounds sterling over million dollars for defending its borders and still the two lordly proprietaries demanded that their vast possessions should entirely exempt from taxation earnest remonstrance the assembly they returned insulting answer which they said are more bound pay taxes than any other chief governor the king colonies your agitation this matter new trick secure your election advise you show the respect due the rank which the crown has been pleased bestow upon the people pennsylvania ordinary times are lightly taxed that they hardly know that they are taxed what fools you are agitating this dangerous topic american taxation beneath the dignity the assembly make trouble about such small sums money not deny that you have been some expense pacifying the indians but that affair ours already give the province larger sum per annum than our share the taxes would amount one for example sent over four hundred pounds worth cannon for the defence our city philadelphia such was their answer was conveyed sixteen sentences which were numbered and which were very similar the ones have given the communication excited great displeasure was considered alike false and insolent even the tranquil mind franklin was fired with indignation replied the document with power eloquence and logic which carried the convictions nearly all the colonists chapter franklin mission england new marks respect lord loudoun gov denny and franklin visit the indians franklin commissioner england his constant good nature loudoun delays wise action english captain the voyagers land falmouth journey london franklin style living london his electrical experiments teaches the

savage horrors retaliating cruelties franklin efforts behalf the moravian indians the general impression produced throughout the colonies the controversy with the proprietaries was that they were very weak men indeed does not appear that they were much regarded even london gentleman writing from that city said they are hardly found the herd gentry not court not office not parliament march franklin left his home for post office tour some forty the officers his regiment well mounted and rich uniform without franklin knowledge came his door escort him out the village franklin says had not previously been made acquainted with their project should have prevented being naturally averse the assuming state any occasion the proprietaries london heard account this affair they were very much displeased saying they had never been thus honored and that princes the blood alone were entitled such distinction the war was still raging large bodies troops were crossing the ocean united with the colonial forces lord loudoun was appointed the court commander chief for america was exceedingly weak and inefficient man scarcely soldier the ranks could found more incompetent for the situation governor morris pennsylvania worn out with his unavailing conflicts with the assembly was withdrawn and the proprietaries sent out captain william denny their obsequious servant his stead the philadelphians hoping conciliate him received him cordially and with public entertainment william franklin wrote change devils according the scotch proverb blithesome the close the feast when most the party were making themselves merry over their wine governor denny took franklin aside into adjoining room and endeavored the most abounding flattery and the bribe rich promises induce him espouse the cause the proprietaries but soon learned that franklin could not influenced any his bribes there was but brief lull the storm governor denny had power his own could only obey the peremptory instructions had received these instructions were irreconcilably hostile the resolves the assembly franklin was the all powerful leader the popular party there was something his imperturbable good nature which difficult explain scenes woe seemed depress his cheerful spirits atrocities oppression could excite his indignation could thrust his keen dagger points into the vitals his antagonist with smile upon his face and jokes upon his lips which would convulse both friend and foe with laughter was the most unrelenting antagonist governor denny the assembly and yet was the only man who remained good terms with the governor visiting him and dining with him governor denny was gentleman and well educated and few men could appear better advantage the saloons fashion but was trammeled beyond all independent action the instructions had received from the proprietaries was right heart was sympathy with franklin and with reluctance endeavored enforce the arbitrary measures with which was entrusted franklin was one the most companionable men his wonderful powers conversation his sweetness temper and his entire ignoring all aristocratic assumption made him one the most fascinating guests every circle charmed alike the rich and the poor the learned and the ignorant november accompanied governor denny the frontier confer with the chiefs several indian tribes the savages say the least were punctilious the observance the laws honor securing the safety the ambassadors such occasion were the english the governor and the philosopher rode side side horseback accompanied only few body servants the governor familiar with the clubs and the wits england entertained franklin the highest degree with the literary gossip london and probably excited his mind intense desire visit those scenes which himself was calculated enjoy and embellish the journey wrote the following comic letter his wife had been disappointed not receiving line from her certain messenger had good mind not write you this opportunity but never can ill natured enough even when there most occasion think won tell you that are well and that expect return about the middle the week nor will send you word news that poz duty mother love the children and miss betsy and gracie your loving husband have scratched out the loving words being writ haste mistake when forgot was angry gov denny unable accomplish his purposes with the assembly resolved make final appeal the king the house promptly decided imitate his example its speaker norris and benjamin franklin were appointed commissioners the speaker declined the office and franklin was left sole commissioner probably was not all reluctant introduced the statesmen the philosophers and the fashionable circles the old world defray his expenses the assembly voted sum nearly eight thousand dollars had also wealth his own correspondence was quite intimately acquainted with very many the scientific men england and france was very certain that would have the any circle which might wish honor with his presence was that time very serious affair cross the atlantic the ocean swarmed with pirates privateers and men war the fourth april franklin with his son william set out from philadelphia his cheerfulness spirits did not forsake him left home where had been remarkably happy for twenty six years the family left behind him consisted his wife his wife aged mother his daughter sarah beautiful child twelve years one two nieces and old nurse the family franklin had written the governor ascertain the precise time when the packet would sail the reply received from him was have given out that the ship sail saturday next but may let you know entre nous that you are there monday morning you will time but not delay any longer franklin was accompanied number his friends far trenton where they spent very joyful evening together one the ferries this road they were delayed obstructions that they could not reach the hudson river until noon monday franklin feared that the ship might sail without him but upon reaching the river was relieved seeing the vessel still the stream eleven weeks passed before lord loudoun would issue his permission for the ship sail every day this most dilatory and incompetent men announced that the packet would sail morrow and thus the weeks rolled while franklin was waiting but not hear single word impatience remonstrance from his lips his philosophy taught him happy under all circumstances with smiling face called upon lord loudoun and dined with him endeavored but vain obtain settlement his claims for supplies furnished braddock army found much the society new york entertain him and more than all and above all was doing everything that could done for the accomplishment his mission why then should worry new york records was growing immensely rich money brought into from all quarters for the pay and subsistence the troops franklin was remarkably gallant his intercourse with ladies kept quite brisk correspondence with several the most brilliant ladies the day man could more prettily pay compliment his lively and beautiful friend miss ray wrote upon his departure present best compliments all that love should have said all that love you but that would giving you too much trouble length lord loudoun granted permission for the packet drop down the lower bay where large fleet ninety vessels was assembled fitted out for attack upon the french louisburg franklin and his friends went board was announced that the vessel would certainly sail morrow for six weeks longer the packet rode there anchor franklin and his companions had for the third time consumed all the provisions they had laid store for the voyage still hear not murmur from our imperturbable philosopher length the signal for sailing was given the whole squadron put sea and the london packet with all the rest was swept forward toward louisburg after voyage five days letter was placed the hands the captain authorizing him quit the fleet and steer for england the days and nights long voyage came and went when the packet midnight gale wind and enveloped fogs was approaching falmouth light house upon some rocks had not been visible suddenly the lifting the fog revealed the light house and the craggy shore over which the surf was fearfully breaking the distance but few rods captain the royal navy who chanced near the helmsman sprang the helm called upon the sailors instantly wear ship and thus the risk snapping every mast saved the vessel and the crew from otherwise immediate and certain destruction there was not that time single light house the north american coast the event impressed the mind franklin deeply and resolved that upon his return light houses should constructed about nine clock the next morning the fog was slowly dispersed and falmouth with its extended tower its battlemented castles and the forests masts was opened before the weary voyagers was sunday morning and the bells were ringing for church the vessel glided into the harbor and joyfully the passengers landed franklin writes the bell ringing for church went thither immediately and with hearts full gratitude returned sincere thanks god far the mercies had received know not whether this devout act was suggested franklin whether courteously fell with the arrangement proposed perhaps some religious companion however certain that the sentence which next followed his letter came gushing from his own mind were roman catholic perhaps should this occasion vow build chapel some saint but not were vow all should build light house required journey two hundred and fifty miles reach london franklin and his son posted london which was the most rapid mode traveling those days they seem have enjoyed the journey the highest degree through blooming beautiful highly cultivated england almost every thing the charming landscape appeared different from the rude settlements which were springing amid the primeval forests the new world they visited the cathedral salisbury stonehenge wilton hall the palatial mansion the earl pembroke england was her loveliest attire perhaps there could not then found upon this globe more lovely drive than that through luxuriant devonshire and over the hampshire downs peter collinson gentleman great wealth first received the travelers his own hospitable mansion

influenced mainly franklin pamphlet sent petition that the province might revert the crown the penns succeeded presenting counter petition signed three hundred the british cabinet its insatiable thirst for universal conquest impelled necessity repel the encroachments other nations equally wicked and equally grasping had been fleet and army fighting all over the world after spending every

war against the french and indians this war was not one their own choosing had been forced upon them the british cabinet its resolve drive the french off the continent north america the americans were allowed representation parliament they were taxed according the caprice the government franklin with patriotic foresight vehemently and with resistless force logic resisted the outrage will perceived that there were now two quite distinct sources controversy first came the conflict with the proprietaries and then rose the still more important strife with the cabinet great britain repel the principle taxation without representation this principle once admitted the crown could tax the americans any amount whatever pleased many unreflecting people could not appreciate these disastrous results thus all the partisans the penns and all the office holders the crown and their friends and there were many such became not only opposed franklin but implacable their hostility the majority the assembly was with him was chosen speaker and then was elected again england carry with him the british court the remonstrances the people against taxation without representation and their earnest petition delivered from the tyranny the penns more unwelcome messages the british court and aristocracy could not well convey was certain that the penns and their powerful coadjutors would set many influences array against him dickinson the assembly remonstrating against this appointment declared that there was man pennsylvania who was more the object popular dislike than benjamin franklin but two years had elapsed since franklin return america after absence from his home six years still remembered fondly the dense happiness which had enjoyed the brilliant circles abroad this added

horseback escorted franklin the ship seldom attended church though always encouraged his wife and daughter was genteel was politic family could scarcely command the respect the community which the midst religious people should living without any apparent object worship the preacher christ church which the family attended was partisan the penns sometimes meddled with politics franklin his parting letter from shipboard wrote his daughter constantly church whoever preaches the active devotion the common prayer book your principal business there and properly attended will more towards amending the heart than sermons generally can for they were composed men much greater piety and wisdom than our common composers sermons can pretend therefore wish that you would never miss the prayer days yet not mean you should despise sermons even the preachers you dislike for the discourse often much better than the man sweet and clear waters come through very dirty earth the voyage was stormy lasted thirty days the evening the tenth december again took his residence the house mrs stephenson and her daughter where was received with delight found several other agents the colonies london who had also been sent remonstrate against the despotic measures which the british cabinet threatened taxing the americans its pleasure without allowing them have any voice deciding upon the sums which they should pay grenville was prime minister was about introduce the stamp act initiatory measure imposed but trivial tax itself but little importance but was intended experiment ascertain whether the americans would submit the principle this fact being once established the government could then proceed demand money its pleasure franklin opposed the tax with all his energies declared his own forceful language the mother mischiefs with four other colonial agents held interview with lord grenville the usual arguments were employed both sides lord grenville was courteous but very decided the americans declared must help england pay the interest her debt and the parliament great britain alone could decide how large amount money the americans should pay the bill was introduced parliament and passed large majority the king signed scrawling hand which some think indicated the insanity was beginning develop the trivial sum expected raised the stamp act amounted scarcely one hundred thousand pounds year was thought that the americans would not venture upon any decisive opposition england for such trifle franklin wrote friend took every step power prevent the passing the stamp act but the tide was too strong against the nation was provoked american claims legislative independence and all parties joined resolving this act settle the point thus franklin entirely failed arresting the passing the stamp act was also equally unsuccessful his endeavor promote change government from the proprietary the royal and still his mission proved success conversations pamphlets and articles the newspapers raised throughout the country such opposition the measure that parliament was compelled repeal the tidings the passage the stamp act was received intelligent america with universal expressions displeasure and with resolves oppose its operation every possible way remarked celebrated theological professor that once said his pupils when you the city preach take your best coat when the country take your best sermon the lords and gentry england were astonished the intelligence displayed the opposition the rural population america they fancied the colonists ignorant ragged people living log cabins scattered through the wilderness and social position two three degrees below european and irish peasantry great was their surprise hear from all the colonies and from the remotest districts each colony the voice intelligent and dignified rebuke the act was into execution the first november before that time franklin had spread through all the mechanical mercantile and commercial classes the conviction that they would suffer ten fold more the interruptions trade which the stamp act would introduce than government could hope gain the measure spread abroad the intelligence which came every fresh arrival that the americans were resolving with wonderful unanimity that they would consume more english manufactures that they would purchase more british goods and that far possible food clothing and household furniture they would depend upon their own productions they had even passed resolves eat more lamb that their flocks might increase that they should have wool enough manufacture their own clothing england had thus far furnished nearly all the supplies for the rapidly increasing colonies already numbering population between two and three millions the sudden cessation this trade was felt nearly every warehouse industry more orders came goods accumulated without purchasers violent opposition arose and vast meetings were held the manufacturing districts remonstrate against the measures the government edmund burke host himself headed the opposition parliament burke and franklin were intimate friends and the renowned orator obtained from the renowned philosopher many those arguments and captivating illustrations which uttered the floor parliament astonished england and reaching our shores electrified america the state affairs became alarming some places the stamps were destroyed others one could found who would venture upon the obnoxious task offering sell them the parliament resolved itself into committee the whole house and spent six weeks hearing testimony respecting the operation the act america the hall was crowded with eager listeners the industrial prosperity the nation seemed stake franklin was the principal witness his testimony overshadowed all the rest the record was read with admiration seldom has man been placed more embarrassing situation and never has one under such circumstances acquitted himself more triumphantly was examined and cross examined before this vast and imposing assemblage the shrewdest lawyers the crown every attempt was made throw him into embarrassment trip him his speech but never for moment did franklin lose his self possession never for instant did hesitate his reply the judgment all his friends not mistake did make his mind seemed omnisciently furnished with all the needful statistics for rigorous examination any mortal was ever exposed burke wrote friend that franklin stood before the bar parliament presented such aspect dignity and intellectual superiority remind him schoolmaster questioned school boys rev george whitefield wrote our worthy friend franklin has gained immortal honor his behavior the bar the house the answer was always found equal not superior the questioner stood unappalled gave pleasure his friends and did honor his country after great agitation and many and stormy debates the haughty government was compelled yield the demands the industrial classes indeed with those england who cried most loudly for the repeal the stamp act there were comparatively few who were influenced any sympathy for the americans any appreciation the justice their cause the loss the american trade was impoverishing them selfish considerations alone their own personal interests moved them action there were individuals and out parliament who recognized the rights englishmen and regarding the americans englishmen and america portion the british empire were heart and with all their energies sympathy with the americans their struggle for their rights when the despotism the british court led that court the infamous measure sending fleets and armies compel the americans submission and the feeble colonists less than three millions number performing the boldest and most heroic deeds ever yet recorded history grasped their arms self defence thus wage war against the most powerful naval and military empire upon this globe lord chatham with moral courage rarely surpassed boldly exclaimed the house lords were american englishman would never lay down arms never never never all england there was man more determined his resolve bring the americans servile obedience than the stubborn king george iii the repeal gave him intense offence the equally unprincipled but more intelligent ministers were compelled the measure they saw clearly that england was menaced with civil war which would array the industrial classes generally against the aristocracy such conflict was far from improbable that the aristocracy would brought grief horace walpole wrote was the clamor trade merchants and manufacturing towns that had borne down all opposition general insurrection was apprehended the immediate consequence upholding the bill the revolt america and the destruction trade was the prospect future still the question the repeal was carried the house but majority one hundred and eight votes course franklin now solicited permission return home the assembly instead granting his request elected him agent for another year does not appear that franklin was disappointed the report his splendid and triumphant examination before the commons and the republication many his pamphlets had raised him the highest position popularity the americans throughout all the provinces received tidings the repeal with unbounded delight bells were rung bon fires blazed cannon were fired never heard much noise life wrote sally her honored papa the very children seemed distracted the tory party england developed little malignity their anger view the discomfiture their plans the bigoted tory johnson wrote bishop white pennsylvania that had been prime minister instead repealing the act would have sent man war and laid one more our largest cities ashes footnote wilson life bishop white the king felt personally aggrieved his denunciations those who favored the repeal were indecent that some his most influential friends ventured intimate him that was highly impolitic indeed the previous narrative has shown many who were entire sympathy with the king and who were bitterly opposed any concession the americans felt compelled vote for the repeal propitiate the unrelenting and half crazed monarch with his obdurate court declaratory act was called was passed which affirmed the absolute supremacy parliament over the colonies hear very much the corruption our own congress said that votes are sometimes bought and sold sir nathaniel wraxall who was member parliament during all this period declares his intensely interesting and undoubtedly honest memoir that under the ministry lord bute ross mackay was employed him corrupter general whose mission was carry important measures government bribery wraxall writes that ross mackay said him dinner party given lord besborough the illustrious guests were sipping their wine the peace was carried through and approved pecuniary dispensation nothing else could have surmounted the difficulty was myself the channel through which the money passed with own hand secured above one hundred and twenty votes that most important question ministers eighty thousand pounds were set apart for the purpose forty members the house commons received from thousand pounds each eighty others paid five hundred pounds piece the unrelenting king was still determined that the americans unrepresented parliament should still pay into his treasury whatever sums money might exact calling his aid courtiers more shrewd than himself they devised very cunning act attain that object way which would hardly likely excite opposition they laid tax insignificant really its amount upon paper paint glass and tea this tax was collected the custom houses the few ports entry the colonies the whole amount thus raised would not exceed forty thousand pounds was thought that the americans would never make opposition trivial payment but established principle that england could tax the colonies without allowing those colonies any representation parliament the court had right thus demand forty thousand pounds they had right demand many millions should seem expedient king and cabinet the great blunder which the court committed was not appreciating the wide spread intelligence the american people new england particularly and throughout the colonies generally there was scarcely farmer who did not perceive the trick and despise they deemed insult their intelligence instantly there arose throughout all the provinces the most determined opposition the measure was fact merely renewal the stamp act under slightly modified forms they admitted the justice this act was only declaring that they had acted with unpardonable folly opposing the tax under the previous form franklin with honest shrewdness not with trickery with cunning but with sincere and penetrating mind eagerly scrutinized all the measures the court george iii was gentleman was irreproachable all his domestic relations was sense conscientious for certainly was not disposed anything which thought wrong conscientious men have burned their fellow christians the stake said that george the third was christian certainly was full believer the religion jesus christ and earnestly advocated the support and extension that religion god makes great allowance for the frailties his fallen children requires the wisdom omniscience decide how much wickedness there may the heart consistently with piety man perfect during the reign george iii terrible wars were waged throughout all the world mainly incited the british court millions perished the moans widows and orphans ascended from every hand this wicked christian king sent his navy and his army burn down our cities and villages and shoot husbands fathers and sons until could compel america submit his despotism the population england being exhausted those wide spread wars hired the petty princes europe innocent peasantry abandon their homes germany burn and destroy the homes americans finding that not sufficient sent his agents through the wilderness rouse bribes savage men who knew better ravage our frontiers burn the cabins lonely farmers tomahawk and scalp their wives and children such man may good christian god who can read the secrets the heart and who infinite his love and charity alone can decide but imagine that man george guelph the bar

was appointed the young colony georgia its london agent the next year new jersey conferred the same honor upon him and the year after was appointed agent his native province massachusetts these several appointments detained him ten years england during all this time did not visit home the equanimity his joyful spirit seems never have been disturbed his pen describes only pleasant scenes murmurs are recorded yearnings home sickness but month after month the animosity the british court towards the americans was increasing the king grew more and more fixed his purpose compel the liberty

expect favors while himself was power and that was determined persevere with firmness the policy which the king was pursuing the king was shielded his ministers that franklin knew but little about him even this time wrote can scarcely conceive king better dispositions more exemplary virtues more truly desirous promoting the welfare his subjects franklin never had occasion speak differently his domestic virtues nay more than probable that the king daily prayer looked god for guidance and that thought that was doing that which was promotive the interests england alas for man can perpetrate the most atrocious crimes honestly believing that doing god will can burn aged women under the charge their being witches can torture the infliction unutterable anguish his brother man mothers and

officials had recommended was transmitted franklin the latter part the summer immediately forwarded lord dartmouth with sent very polite and conciliatory letter which declared that the americans were very desirous being good terms with the mother country that their resentment against the government was greatly abated finding that americans had urged the obnoxious measures which had been adopted and that the present was very favorable time introduce cordial friendly relations between the king and the colonists lord dartmouth returned very polite reply laid the all important petition aside and

officers the council had appointed lawyer defend hutchinson and oliver his name was wedderburn had already obtained celebrity for the savage skill with which could browbeat witness and for his wonderful command the vocabulary vituperation and abuse before commencing the examination addressed the assembly long speech after eulogizing governor hutchinson one the best and most loyal the officers the crown who merited the gratitude king and court turned upon franklin and assailed him with storm vituperative epithets such never before and never since has fallen upon the head man the council were sympathy with the speaker often his malignant thrusts would elicit from those lords general shout derisive laughter such was the treatment which one the most illustrious and honored american citizens received from the privy council king george iii when appeared before that council friendly ambassador from his native land seeking only conciliation and peace wedderburn accused franklin stealing private letters misrepresenting their contents that might excite hostility against the loyal officers the king accused him doing this that might eject them from office obtain the

himself charges better calculated ruin man the view these proud lords can scarcely conceived doubtful whether there were another man the world who could have received them calmly and the end could have magnificently triumphed over them during all this really terrific assailment franklin stood with his head resting his left hand apparently unmoved the close declined answering any questions the committee the council reported that same day the lords the committee agree humbly report their opinion your majesty that the said petition founded upon resolution formed upon false and erroneous allegations and that the same false vexatious and scandalous and calculated only for the seditious purposes keeping spirit clamor and discontent said province the king accepted the report and acted accordingly franklin went home alone know not why his friends thus apparently deserted him the next morning which was sunday priestly breakfasted franklin table represents him saying that could not have borne the insults heaped upon him the privy council but for the consciousness that had done only that which was right monday morning franklin received laconic letter from the postmaster general informing him that the king had found necessary dismiss him from the office deputy postmaster general america this outrage inflicted the privy council great britain upon friendly ambassador from her colonies who had visited her court with the desire promote union and harmony was one the most atrocious acts ever perpetrated men above the rank vagabonds their drunken carousals franklin transmitting

which conveys them becomes obnoxious loss know how peace and union are maintained and restored between the different parts the empire grievances cannot redressed unless they are known and they cannot known but through complaints and petitions these are deemed affronts and the messengers punished offenders who will henceforth send petitions and who will deliver them the speech wedderburn gave great delight all the tory party was derisively said that the lords the council went their chamber bull baiting and hounded the solicitor general with loud applause and laughter fox writing the assault said all men tossed their hats and clapped their hands boundless delight when the tidings the affair reached america added intensity the animosity then rapidly increasing against the british government the dismissal franklin from the post office was deemed equivalent the seizure the crown that important branch the government none but the creatures the ministry were postmasters consequently patriotic americans could longer entrust their letters the mail private arrangements were immediately made for the conveyance letters and with much efficiency that the general office which had heretofore contributed fifteen thousand dollars annually the public treasury never after paid into one farthing footnote may worthy record that wedderburn became the hero the clubs and the favorite the tory

graciously and would submit the consideration parliament was thought not respectful the king publish before had presented that body but usual the infatuation both king and court was such that everything that came from the americans was treated with neglect not with contempt the all important petition was buried pile documents upon all conceivable subjects and not one word was said commend the consideration either house for three days remained unnoticed franklin then with his two companions solicited permission heard the bar the house their request was refused this brought the question into debate the house commons was that time but reflected image the house lords was composed almost exclusively the younger sons the nobles and such other obsequious servants the aristocracy they with their vast wealth and patronage saw fit have elected there was immense tory majority the house they assailed the petition with vulgarity abuse which could scarcely exceeded and then dismissed from

making preparations return philadelphia the aged illustrious eloquent earl chatham one the noblest england all grasping and ambitious sons sought interview with franklin utterly condemned the policy the british cabinet his sympathies were not only from principles policy but from convictions justice cordially with the americans felt sure that unless the court should retrace its steps war would ensue and american independence would follow and that england with the loss her colonies would find mercantile impoverishment and political weakness the course conversation implied that america might

company eating drinking and conversing with them freely had never heard any conversation from any person drunk sober the least expression wish for separation hint that such thing would advantageous america subsequent interview the earl chatham alluding the conduct congress drawing the petition and address said they have acted with much temper moderation and wisdom that think the most honorable assembly statesmen since those the greeks and romans the most virtuous times subsequent interview franklin expressed the earl his apprehension that the continuance the british army boston which was the source constant irritation the people might eventually lead quarrel perhaps between drunken porter and soldier and that thus tumult and bloodshed might introduced leading consequences which one could foresee lord chatham felt the force these remarks which soon received their striking illustration what was called the boston massacre therefore declared his intention repairing the house lords introduce resolve for the immediate withdrawal the troops from boston the tidings were soon noised abroad that the eloquent earl then probably the most illustrious man england was make speech favor america the eventful day arrived the hall was crowded franklin had special invitation from the earl present the friends america were there few numbers and the enemies all their strength lord chatham made speech which logical power and glowing eloquence has perhaps never been surpassed franklin had impressed him with the conviction that the determination the americans defend their rights was such that with fleet and army the government were ravage all the coast and burn all the cities the americans would retreat back into the forests the maintenance their liberty full this idea lord chatham exclaimed with prophetic power shall forced ultimately retract let retract while can not when must say must necessarily undo these violent oppressive acts you will repeal them pledge myself for stake reputation will consent taken for idiot they are not finally repealed franklin writes all availed more than the whistling the wind the motion was rejected sixteen scotch peers and twenty four bishops with all the lords possession expectation places when they vote together unanimously for ministerial measures they generally make dead majority that renders all debate ridiculous itself since can answer end though the speech produced impression upon the obdurate house lords had very powerful effect upon the public mind was read america collegiate halls the work shop and the farmer fireside with delight which cannot described few days after the speech franklin writing lord stanhope said franklin filled with admiration that truly great man has seen the course life sometimes eloquence without wisdom and often wisdom without eloquence the present instance sees both united and both thinks the highest degree possible slowly the ministry were awaking the conviction that american affairs not settled might yet cause them much trouble various underhand ways they approached franklin was generally understood that every man had his price that the influence one man could bought for few hundred pounds that another would require lucrative and honorable office though the reputation franklin was such that was delicate matter approach him with bribes still some them now commenced course flattery endeavoring secure his was thought that his influence with his countrymen was great that they would accede any terms should recommend lord howe called upon franklin and the name lord north and lord dartmouth the two most influential members the ministry informed him that they sincerely sought reconciliation and that they were prepared listen favorably any reasonable propositions might offer lord howe was the friend franklin and america these unexpected and joyful tidings affected franklin deeply that could not conceal the tears which rolled down his cheeks lord howe then added that was instructed say that the service would thus render both england and america would priceless value and that though the ministers could not think influencing him any selfish motives might expect return any reward which was the power government bestow this said franklin was what the french vulgarly called spitting the soup but again there was meeting parliament again became evident that the ministry would accede terms which did not secure the entire subjugation america lord chatham made renewed attempt conciliate his propositions were rejected with scorn the meantime franklin had presented some hints drawn the most liberal spirit compromise but which still maintained the american principle that the colonists could not taxed the pleasure the court without having any voice themselves the amount which they were pay soon after this barclay called upon franklin the name the government and after long and franklin disgusting diplomatic harangue ventured say him that would only comply with the wishes the ministry might expect almost any reward could wish for even the imperturbable spirit franklin was roused replied the ministry sure would rather give place cart tyburn than any other place whatever sincerely wish serviceable and need other inducement that might another interview which soon followed appeared that the government refused concede single point which the americans deemed essential they refused withdraw the troops refused allow the colonial governors appoint the collectors the customs persisted building fortresses hold the people subjection and adhered the claim parliament legislate for the colonies franklin said while parliament claims the power altering our constitution pleasure there can agreement are rendered unsafe every privilege and are secure nothing barclay insolently replied would well for the americans come agreement with the court great britain they ought not forget how easy thing will for the british men war lay all their seaport towns ashes grew warm writes franklin said that the chief part little property consisted houses those towns that they might make bon fires them whenever they pleased that the fear losing them would never alter resolution resist the last such claims parliament and that behoved this country take care what mischief did for that sooner later would certainly obliged make good all damages with interest still again these corrupt men who are selling themselves and buying others approached franklin with attempts bribe him they could not comprehend that any man could above the reach such influences was contemplated sending lord howe america commissioner applied franklin with him friend assistant secretary lord howe said franklin that could not think undertaking the mission without him that effected any thing valuable must owing the advice franklin would afford him and that should make scruple giving him the full honor assured him that the ministry did not expect his assistance without proper consideration that they wished make generous and ample appointments for those who aided them and also would give them the promise subsequent more ample rewards and said with marked emphasis that the ministry may have opportunity showing their good disposition toward yourself will you give leave franklin procure for you previously some mark suppose the payment here the arrears your salary agent for new england which understand they have stopped for some time past will remembered that lord howe was sincerely the friend america and that anxiously desired see friendly relations restored franklin therefore restrained his displeasure and courteously replied lord shall deem great honor any shape joined with your lordship good work but you hope service from any influence may supposed have drop all thoughts procuring any previous favors from ministers accepting them would destroy the very influence you propose make use they would considered many bribes betray the interests country only let see the propositions and shall not hesitate for moment repeated interviews ensued between franklin and both the friends and the enemies the americans there were interminable conferences but the court was implacable its resolve maintain supreme and exclusive control over the colonies every hour franklin time was engrossed merchants and manufacturers tories and the opposition lords temporal and lords spiritual all called upon him with their several plans there were many americans london including large number quakers these crowded the apartment franklin the negotiations were terminated debate the house lords which the americans were assailed the vilest language insult and abuse which can coined franklin was present writes were treated with the utmost contempt the lowest mankind and almost different species from the english britain particularly american honesty was abused some the lords who asserted that were all knaves and wanted only this dispute avoid paying our debts franklin returned his home with feelings indignation which his calm spirit had rarely before experienced resolved longer have any thing with the hostile governing powers england had loved the british empire felt proud its renown and that america was but part and parcel its greatness but there was longer hope that there could any escape from the awful appeal arms though that measure would fraught with inconceivable woes for his countrymen was assured that they would never submit they would now march independence though the path led through scenes conflagration blood and unutterable woe his experience placed him advance all his countrymen franklin immediately commenced packing his trunks astonishing almost incredible may appear the evidence seems conclusive that through all these trying scenes franklin was cheerful hardly too strong word use jovial man has been well said that angry punish one self for the sins another our philosopher had idea making himself unhappy because british lords behaved like knaves continued one the most entertaining companions cloudless sun seemed shine wherever moved made witty speeches wrote the most amusing articles for the journals and the invariable gayety his mind caused his society eagerly sought for one evening attended quite brilliant party nobleman house who was friend america the conversation chanced turn upon esop fables was said that that mine illustration was exhausted franklin after moment thought remarked that many new fables could invented instructive any those esop gay fontaine can you think one now asked lord think said franklin you will furnish with pencil and paper immediately sat down surrounded the gay assembly and wrote rapidly his pencil could move the eagle and the cat once upon time eagle scaling round farmer barn and espying hare darted down upon him like sunbeam seized him his claws and remounted with him into the air soon found that had creature more courage and strength than the hare for which had mistaken cat the snarling and scrambling his prey were very inconvenient and what was worse she had disengaged herself from his talons grasped his body with her four limbs stop his breath and seized fast hold his throat with her teeth pray said the eagle let your hold and will release you very fine said the cat but have fancy fall from this height and crushed death you have taken and you shall stoop and let down the eagle thought necessary stoop accordingly this admirable fable was read the company and all were sympathy with america was received with great applause little however did any them then imagine how invincible was the animal the british government was about clutch its talons supposing defenseless hare franklin spent his last day london with priestly the doctor bears glowing testimony his admirable character many thought franklin heartless since view all the horrors civil war his hilarity was never interrupted priestly alluding this charge against franklin says that they spent the day looking over the american papers and extracting from them passages published england reading them writes franklin was frequently not able proceed for the tears literally running down his cheeks upon his departure surrendered his agency arthur lee was the march when franklin embarked portsmouth pennsylvania packet franklin was apprehensive until the last moment that would not permitted depart that the court which had repeatedly denounced him traitor would arrest him some frivolous charge the voyage wrote minute narrative his diplomatic career occupying two hundred and fifty pages foolscap this important document was given his son william franklin who was daily becoming more inveterate tory endeavoring ingratiate himself into favor with the court from which had received the appointment governor franklin also sent copy jefferson perhaps apprehensive that his son might not deal fairly with document which terribly condemned the british government the governor subsequently published the narrative but there reason suppose that suppressed those passages which revealed most clearly the atrocious conduct the british cabinet jefferson wrote some years later alluding this document remember that lord north answers were dry unyielding the spirit unconditional submission and betrayed absolute indifference the occurrence rupture and said the mediators distinctly last that rebellion was not deprecated the part great britain that the confiscations would produce would provide for many their friends the idea that the feeble americans

dared not betray their trust washington adams jay would have made almost any conceivable sacrifice their personal interest they could have averted the calamity separation from the home their ancestors but the conduct the british cabinet was not only despotic the highest degree but was insolent and contemptuous beyond all endurance seemed generally assumed that man born the majestic continent north america instead being born their little island must inferior being they regarded americans slave holders were accustomed regard the negro almost every interview resolved itself into insult courteous intercourse was impossible affection gave place detestation the september congress assembled philadelphia lexington bunker hill and other hostile acts our implacable foes had thrown the whole country into the most intense agitation military companies were every where being organized musket manufactories and powder mills were reared ladies were busy scraping lint and preparing bandages and what was the cause all this commotion which converted america for seven years into aceldama blood and woe was that haughty insolent men england claimed the right impose taxes whatever amount they pleased upon their brother men america they did not blush say the prerogative englishmen demand you americans such sums money want unless like obsequious slaves you pay the money without murmuring will burn your cities and deluge your whole land blood washington was assembling quite army american troops around boston holding the foe close siege there franklin was sent congress one committee three confer with

admiring him whose character from infancy had been taught venerate found him social but not talkative and when spoke something useful dropped from his tongue was grave yet pleasant and affable you know make some pretensions physiognomy and thought that could read his countenance the virtues his heart and with that blended every virtue christian the conference lasted four days and resulted the adoption very important measures while the camp news came the burning portland then falmouth was deed which would have disgraced american savages the town was entirely defenceless held out menace whatever the foe the cold blasts maine winter were hand british man war entered the harbor and giving but few hours notice that the sick and the dying might removed and that the women and children might escape from shot and shell the frozen fields one hundred and thirty humble peaceful homes were laid ashes the cruel flames consumed nearly all their household furniture their clothing and the frugal food they had laid store for their long and dreary winter few houses escaped the shells marines were landed apply the torch them that the destruction might complete there were several vessels the harbor the freezing starving homeless wives and daughters who had not strength toil through the wilderness seek distant cabins refuge might perhaps escape them prevent this they were burned the water edge was infernal deed struck the very heart america even now after lapse one hundred years american can read account this outrage without the flushed cheek and the moistened eye which indignation creates mrs adams wrote could not join day the petitions our worthy pastor for reconciliation between our longer parent but tyrant state and these colonies let separate they are longer worthy our brethren let renounce them and instead supplications formerly for their prosperity and happiness let beseech the almighty blast their councils and bring naught all their devices though franklin was the sweetest tempered men returned philadelphia with his spirit greatly embittered against the demoniac foes his country for some time jokes escaped his lips pen december arnold then patriot and brave soldier had made unsuccessful attack upon quebec had retired montreal franklin was again appointed one these commissioners visit arnold and advise respecting canadian affairs most the canadians were catholics one the commissioners was charles carroll carollton had brother john catholic priest man high culture irreproachable character and sincere patriot was perfectly familiar with the french language the solicitation congress was induced accompany his brother this mission was hoped that would able exert powerful influence over the canadian clergy franklin and john carroll became intimate and loving friends speaks well for both that the free thinking philosopher and the catholic priest could recognize each other virtues forget their speculative differences mutual regard there was before the commissioners very laborious journey five hundred miles much leading through almost unexplored wilderness shows great zeal franklin that the age seventy was willing encounter such exposure late march the commissioners left philadelphia two days they reached new york they found the place deserted its inhabitants was held but few soldiers was hourly expected that the british from their fleet and batteries would open upon terrific bombardment how little can imagine the sufferings which must ensue when thousands families are driven terror from their homes from all their means support they know not where and live they know not how few sad days were passed the ruined town and the april the party embarked five the afternoon packet for albany seven clock the morning the day after eventful voyage which they narrowly escaped shipwreck from gale the highlands they landed albany where they were hospitably entertained general schuyler after brief rest the they set out for saratoga which was distant about thirty two miles they were conveyed over exceedingly rough road rocks and corduroy and mire large heavy country wagon from this place franklin wrote begin apprehend that have undertaken fatigue which time life may prove too much for after short tarry the country seat general sullivan saratoga the party moved toward lake george those northern latitudes the ground was still covered with snow and the lake was filled with floating ice two days very exhausting travel brought them the southern shore the beautiful but then dreary lake here they took large boat thirty six feet long and eight broad was what was called bateau which was flat bottomed and was but one foot depth there was one mast and blanket sail which was available when the wind was directly aft there was cabin mere awning sheltered partially from wind and rain thus they crept across the lake through masses ice distance thirty six miles thirty six hours there was neck land four miles breadth which separated lake george from lake champlain the heavy boat placed wheels was dragged across six yoke oxen delay five days was thus caused before they were ready embark the latter lake the navigation this small sheet water surrounded the primeval forest and with scarcely the cabin white man seen must have been romantic indeed they sailed when the wind favored and rowed when was adverse night they ran ashore built their camp fire which illumined lake and forest boiled their coffee cooked their viands and some under the awning and some under the shelter hastily constructed camp slept sweetly the ice greatly impeded their progress three and half days they reached john near the upper end the lake the toilsome journey another day brought them montreal none the commissioners were accustomed thus roughing all were greatly exhausted council war was convened canada was clearly lost the americans was once decided that nothing remained but withdraw the troops early june franklin reached philadelphia from his toilsome journey had been absent about ten weeks the doom the proprietary government over pennsylvania was now sealed congress had voted that all authority derived from the king england was extinct conference delegates was appointed organize new government for the province franklin was course one these delegates committee had been appointed congress draw declaration independence the committee consisted jefferson franklin adams livingston and sherman the immortal document all the world knows came from the pen jefferson was offered congress for acceptance many frivolous objections were course presented one man thought this phrase little too severe another thought that little too lenient franklin sat the side jefferson the admirable document was subjected this assailment turning him said one the most characteristic and popular all his utterances when was journeyman printer one companions apprenticed hatter was about open shop for himself his first concern was have handsome sign board with proper inscription composed these words john thompson hatter makes and sells hats for ready money but thought would submit his friends for their amendments the first showed thought the word hatter tautologous because followed the words makes hats which showed that was hatter was struck out the next observed that the word makes might well omitted because his customers would not care who made the hats good and their mind they would buy whomsoever made struck out third said thought the words for ready money were useless was not the custom the place sell credit every one who purchased expected pay they were parted with the inscription now stood john thompson sells hats sells hats says his next friend why nobody will expect you give them away what then the use that word was stricken out and hats followed the rather there was one painted the board his inscription was reduced ultimately john thompson with the figure hat subjoined will remembered the readiness with which franklin the spur the moment threw off the admirable fable the eagle and the hare altogether probable that the inexhaustible resources his genius improvised this anecdote meet the exigencies the occasion when the hessian troops whom england had hired german prince arrived intelligent men this country pitied rather than blamed those simple hearted peasants who had animosity whatever against the americans they had been compelled their feudal lord who was really their slave master leave their lowly homes the rhine unite with english regulars and painted savages burning the homes and butchering the people struggling for existence the wilderness the new world again the all availing pen franklin was called into requisition direction congress drew friendly address these unfortunate men offering every german who would abandon the ignominious service which his prince had sold him tract rich land sufficient for ample farm the address was translated into german various were the devices adopted give the document circulation the hessian camp doubtless exerted powerful influence disarming these highly disciplined troops all animosity the effect was perhaps seen the spectacle witnessed few weeks afterwards when nine hundred these soldiers were led through the streets philadelphia prisoners war not improbable that many them were more than willing throw down their arms the july franklin was chosen the convention one nine delegates represent pennsylvania the national congress one the great difficulties surmounted union the states was give the great states like new york and pennsylvania their own preponderance the confederacy while the minor states like new jersey and delaware should not shorn their influence the difficulty was finally obviated the present admirable arrangement which each state great small has two representatives the senate while their representation the house depends upon the number the population franklin excelled the art putting things silenced the demand the smaller states all respects equality with the larger saying let the smaller colonies give equal money and men and then have equal vote but they have equal vote without bearing equal burdens confederation upon such iniquitous principles will never last long the convention form constitution for the state pennsylvania met philadelphia the july franklin was unanimously chosen president pen can describe the intensity his labors all appreciated his consummate wisdom and yielded readily his suggestions troops were hurrying and fro one hundred and twenty british war vessels were new york harbor one knew upon what seaport the thunderbolts this formidable armament would hurled the americans had been defeated long island august and had almost miraculously escaped with their field pieces and stores across the east river new york this brilliant retreat was deemed the americans almost equivalent victory lord howe the old friend franklin and humane and respected englishman who was sincerely desirous peace with the colonies was appointed admiral the king naval forces accepted the appointment with the hope that the aid franklin reconciliation might effected still was englishman and could not conceive that americans had any rights which the english government was bound respect the degree his infatuation may inferred from the fact that soon reached our shores published declaration which circulated far and wide stating that the americans would only give the conflict and return implicit submission the british government would forgive their sins pardon the guilty ones with few exceptions and receive them again favor the weak man seemed really think that this was extraordinary act clemency the part the english court the reply which franklin drew the declaration was grand and was the more grand when reflect that was addressed man who was supported army know not how many thousand british regulars and fleet one hundred and twenty war vessels many which were gigantic armament admiral howe had written courteous private letter franklin which enclosed the declaration congress gave franklin permission reply wrote lord the official despatches which you refer contain nothing more than offers pardon upon submission directing pardon offered the colonies who are the very parties injured expresses indeed that opinion our ignorance baseness and insensibility which your uninformed and proud nation has long been pleased entertain impossible that should think submission government that has with the most wanton barbarity and cruelty burnt our defenseless towns the midst winter excited the savages massacre our farmers and our slaves murder their masters and even now bringing foreign mercenaries deluge our settlements with blood have not space copy the remainder this admirable letter was delivered lord howe board his flag ship new york harbor ten days after its date read his countenance expressed surprise and almost his only remark was old friend has expressed himself very warmly few weeks later this good natured but weak man paroled general sullivan who was prisoner war and sent him philadelphia with message congress which lord howe cautiously declined put upon paper general sullivan reduced the message writing and presented congress was substance follows the government england cannot admit that congress legitimate body recognized any diplomatic relations whatever but tumultous assembly men who have treasonably conspired against their lawful sovereign still the government willing that lord howe should confer with some the members congress private gentlemen see some terms accommodation cannot arranged after much and earnest discussion which great diversity opinion prevailed was voted that general sullivan should inform admiral howe that committee three would sent ascertain whether has any authority treat with persons authorized congress for that purpose benjamin franklin john adams and edward rutledge composed this committee antique house nearly hundred years old formerly the abode wealth and splendor which stood green lawn but few rods from the beach the western shore staten island was chosen the place for the conference two days journey conveyed the committee amboy opposite the house adams traveled horseback franklin and rutledge two wheel chaise admiral howe sent boat under the protection flag truce with officer who stated that was left behind hostage for their safe return promptly they declined manifesting any such distrust the honor admiral howe and took the hostage back the boat with them the barge propelled lusty rowers soon reached the staten island shore large apartment the old stone house had been richly decorated with moss and branches honor the occasion regiment hessians was posted that spot the colonel drew them two lines and through this lane soldiers the commissioners advanced from the beach the house when admiral howe saw that the officer had sent hostage had been returned said gentlemen you pay high compliment cordially the kind hearted admiral received his guests and invited them ample collation cold ham tongues mutton and wine henry strachey secretary lord howe wrote very full report the interview which accords entirely with the narrative which john adams presented congress sincere and friendly words human lips could pronounce the admiral assured the american gentlemen his earnest desire promote reconciliation between the colonists and the mother country alluded the fact that england had been regarded the friend america and the honor massachusetts had conferred upon his family rearing monument his brother who had fallen ticonderoga franklin well knew that howe was regarded the friend america assure you gentlemen said lord howe that esteem that honor family above all things this world such gratitude and affection this country that account that feel for america for brother and america should fall should feel and lament like the loss brother the reply franklin these sincere words seems little discourteous assuming air great indifference and confidence though the fall america was idea not thought bowed and with one his blandest smiles said assure you lord that will everything our power save your lordship from that mortification the admiral was feeling too deeply for jokes was wounded the rebuke apparently contained the reply his old friend but must not forgotten that franklin the sweetest tempered men had not yet recovered from the indignation caused the barbarities inflicted the british government upon the families falmouth every day was bringing tidings the atrocities which england through its savage allies was perpetrating the frontiers burning the cabins lonely farmers and tomahawking and scalping women and children and was constrained look upon lord howe the agent that government commissioned bear the patriots america only the insulting messages that the king and his ministers would graciously pardon them the crime attempting resist their despotism they would ask forgiveness and future submit uncomplainingly the requirements the crown thus while the kind hearted admiral with bosom glowing with brotherly sympathy was acting upon the assumption that the americans should cherish undying emotions gratitude the king that was ready forgive their disobedience his commands franklin and his companions found difficult restrain their emotions indignation view the truly diabolical course pursued the british government the court their judgment merited the execrations not only americans but all humanity lord howe very emphatically wished the commissioners understand that met them merely private individuals and that could not the slightest degree recognize any authority congress franklin coldly replied your lordship may consider any view you may think proper our part are liberty consider ourselves our real character john adams replied with warmth characteristic his impetuous nature your lordship may consider what light you please indeed should willing consider myself for few moments any character which would agreeable your lordship except that british subject the conversation was continued franklin said have been deputed congress simply inquire your lordship what proposition you have offer for the consideration congress british troops have ravaged our country and burnt our towns cannot again happy under the government great britain all former attachments are obliterated america can never return the domination great britain adams added lord not our power treat otherwise than independent states for part avow determination never depart from the idea independency rutledge gave emphasis these decisive words saying with regard the people consenting come again under the english government impossible can answer for south carolina the royal government there was very oppressive last took the government into our own hands the people are now settled and happy under that government they would not now return the king government even congress should desire here the conference ended lord howe stating that they insisted upon independence accommodation was possible lord howe courteously accompanied the american gentlemen the barge and they were rowed over the new jersey shore the report they made congress they stated that the commission lord howe only conferred upon him authority grant pardon the americans with few exceptions upon their entire submission the king required those days long time cross the atlantic seldom could answer obtained letter less than four

and the request count buffon had translated into french franklin treatise upon electricity this letter was very cautiously written covered many sheets paper the all important substance the letter was almost concealed from view the mass verbiage which was enveloped but careful reading indicated that the french ministry and the nation were sympathy with the americans that while the ministry wished avoid war with england they would gladly could done secretly send the americans money and powder cannon and muskets and that many french generals note were eager join the american army and confer upon

england that haughty government had long been the most unpopular the globe england had made great conquests from france and was rich intelligent and powerful beyond any other nation prosperity had given her arrogance and she had placed her heel upon her humiliated neighbors there was not court europe which would not have rejoiced see england humbled the despotic court france and the most haughty nobles were ready encounter any perils which held out reasonable hope that england might weakened thus the sympathies all france were united favor america and now the hour had come aiding the americans who had boldly declared their independence they might not only deprive england those colonies whose trade was already invaluable england and which were rapidly increasing population wealth and power but also they might awaken such gratitude the bosoms americans that the trade the new nation would mainly transferred france thus the court and the nobles intent upon this object did not

integrity but had inherited from his english ancestry not only repulsive brusqueness but also prejudice against the french which nothing could remove his want courtesy his unconcealed assumption that france was acting out unmitigated selfishness and that consequently the americans owed the french debt gratitude often caused franklin much embarrassment this blunt man one time wrote uncourteous not

refined french ladies dinner parties glittering with gold and silver plate social intercourse with men whose philosophical attainments were the highest order and whose politeness speech and bearing rendered them delightful companions franklin found his time and thoughts engrossed all his voluminous writings find allusion those tremendous wrongs which louis xiv and louis had entailed upon the people wrongs which soon convulsed society with the volcanic throes the french revolution jefferson who succeeded franklin was cast different mould saw and fully comprehended the misery under which the millions the french peasantry were groaning and this led him the conviction that people could safe unless the government were placed their own hands still franklin like his brother deists hume and voltaire seeing how impotent were all the motives they could urge make man virtuous became thoroughly disgusted with human nature even went beyond paul his description the hopeless depravity man the idea reclaiming him his philosophy was abandoned entirely and yet was not prepared embrace that gospel which the experience ages has proved the wisdom god and the power god unto salvation enlarges

proposals believe there not man america few english tories excepted that would not spurn the thought deserting noble and generous friend for the sake truce with unjust and cruel enemy british diplomacy tried all its arts intrigue separate america from france the negotiations for peace but all vain the british minister grenville interview with franklin ridiculed the idea that america owed france any gratitude urging that france sought only her own selfish interests told him franklin writes that was strongly impressed with the kind assistance afforded france our distress and the

burke wrote warm congratulatory letter franklin footnote edmund burke wrote franklin that the motion was the declaration two hundred and thirty four members but was the opinion thought the whole house and now the final struggle arose respecting the terms peace the three great questions discussed diplomatic arrangements were gradually and very cautiously entered into were what shall the boundaries the united states shall the americans allowed fish the great banks what provision shall made for the tories america whose estates have been confiscated there were many preliminary meetings private semi official and official there was general impression that franklin was the man whose opinion would entirely control that his countrymen was approached every way and the utmost endeavors were made induce the american commissioners enter into private treaty without consulting the french ministry full account the diplomatic conflict which ensued would fill volume one occasion the british minister grenville said case england grants america independence the french minister vergennes smiled and said america has already won her independence she does not ask you there franklin will answer you that point sure franklin said not consider necessary bargain for that which our own have bought our independence the expense much blood and treasure and are full possession many these preliminary

their supposed ends footnote diplomatic correspondence the american revolution viii jay was insanely suspicious the french that was afraid that the french ministry would send spies pick the locks his lodgings and steal his important papers therefore always carried them about his person also believed that count vergennes had actually proposed the british minister that they should unite their armies seize the united states and divide america between them such were the colleagues united with franklin the negotiations for peace required all his consummate wisdom able guide affairs wisely under such difficult circumstances may doubted whether there was another man america who could have surmounted the obstacles over which triumphed both franklin colleagues regarded him with suspicion they believed that had been won over such sympathy with the french that would willing sacrifice the interests his own country please them they wrote letters home severely denouncing him and they seemed stand more fear france than england franklin wrote adams very staunch against the tories more decided great deal upon that point than jay myself the british ministers insisted that the confiscated estates the american tories should restored them and all their losses reimbursed franklin silenced the demand drawing from his pocket the following articles which proposed should added the treaty

articles was restored the january count vergennes and the british minister fitzherbert signed their preliminaries the presence franklin and adams not till then did the english order hostilities suspended and declare the senseless war end there was universal satisfaction america with the exception the king and few his ministers there was general satisfaction england true that the national pride was sorely humiliated but after all these woes which england had inflicted upon america her own statesmen with almost undivided voice declared that the interests both nations were alike promoted having few feeble colonies elevated into the rich and flourishing republic the united states thus the war the american revolution must pronounced have been the part england which forced one the most disastrous and senseless those blunders which have ever accompanied the progress our race footnote contemplate the still greater blunder our civil war was forced upon the nation the slave traders that

triumph paul and thousands others who have varied language expressed the sentiment that jesus can make dying bed feel soft downy pillows are few hours before his death some one urged him change his position that might breathe easier replied dying man can nothing easy these were his last words then sank into lethargy from which passed into that sleep which has earthly waking was eleven clock night april had lived eighty four years three months and eleven days but candid and charitable reader can peruse this narrative without the admission that benjamin franklin notwithstanding his imperfections was one the wisest and best all the fallen children adam from his dying hour the present day his memory has been justly cherished with reverence and affection throughout the civilized

printer the office which worked stood the corner franklin avenue and court street for three years franklin was thus employed apparently never seeking recreation and never having moment leisure save such could rescue from sleep from his meals there were that time several bookstores boston the eminent men that province had brought with them the new world literary and scientific tastes high order even then the axe the settler had been heard but short distance the primeval forests which still encircled all the large towns bears were not unfrequently shot from long wharf they swam from island island endeavored cross the solitary bay said that that time twenty bears were often shot week benjamin franklin inspired his love reading cultivated friendly relations with the clerks the bookstores from them borrowed interesting volumes which took home the evening with the utmost care and having spent most the night reading would return them early hour the morning before the master the shop had time miss them something the demeanor franklin attracted the attention merchant boston the name matthew adams invited him his library and loaned him books the lad uncle benjamin england who was very fond composing rhymes which called poetry sent many his effusions his favorite nephew and opened quite brisk correspondence with him thus benjamin soon became fluent rhymester and wrote sundry ballads which were sold the streets and became quite popular there was great demand that time for narratives the exploits pirates the doom murderers and wild love adventures said that one the boston publishers the sale ballads alone found very lucrative business benjamin who found very easy write doggerel verse wrote one ballad called the light house tragedy was graphic and what would called the present day sensational account shipwreck which the captain and his two daughters perished wrote another which was still more captivating and which all its main features was historically true was account the world renowned pirate edward teach usually called blackbeard the reader will find minute narrative the career that monster the volume this series pioneers and patriots entitled captain

wretched stuff franklin afterwards admitted but remembered was then but boy fifteen having composed the ballad and set type and printed was then sent hawk through the streets this was certainly remarkable achievement for lad his years the eagerness with which both the ballads were seized the public must have greatly gratified the self esteem the young writer addison was bungler talk but every sentence from his pen was elegant once said carry loose change pocket but can draw for thousand pounds burke said goldsmith writes like angel but talks like poor poll franklin was means bungler his speech but was not fluent hesitated and was loss for words but whatever wrote had wonderful flow harmony the right word was always the right place doubtless had devoted much attention the acquirement conversational ease did skill writing would have been successful the one art the other from early life was his great ambition not merely fine but forcible writer did not seek splendor diction but that perspicuity that transparency expression which would convey the thought most directly the mind odd volume the spectator fell his way was charmed with the style selecting some interesting incident would read with the closest care would then close the book endeavoring retain the thought only without regard the expression then with pen hand would sit down and relate the anecdote the incident the most forceful and graphic words his vocabulary would afford this would correct and correct minutely attending the capitals and the punctuation until had made all respects perfect was his power then compared his narrative with that the spectator course usually found many faults which had committed but occasionally could not but admit had improved upon his original this encouraged him with the hope that long continued practice might become able writer the english language this practice continued for months varying many ways continued rhyme though admitted that there was little poetry his verse the exercise however thought useful giving him mastery language though franklin wrote ballads seemed mainly interested reading books the most elevated and instructive character locke essay the human understanding studied thoroughly the art thinking the messrs port royal engrossed all his energies but perhaps there was book that time which produced deep and abiding impression his mind the memorabilia socrates xenophon franklin was fond arguing was naturally disputatious with his keen intellect was pretty sure come off victor least his own judgment discussions with his associates but the socratic method argumentation different from that which had been accustomed indulge once secured his approval and admiration socrates was never guilty the discourtesy assailing opponent with flat contradiction positive assertion with politeness which never failed him and modesty demeanor which won the regard all others would lead his fellow disputant series questions assent the views which advocated franklin immediately commenced practicing upon this newly discovered art was remarkably successful and became one the most agreeable and beloved companions but ere long became satisfied the folly these disputations which each party struggles not for truth but for victory simply exercise intellectual gladiatorship which the man who has the most skill and muscle discomfits his antagonist jefferson warned his nephew avoid disputation says have never known during long life any persons engage dispute which they did not separate each more firmly convinced than before the correctness his own views franklin enjoyed marvellous health his digestive powers were perfect could live upon any thing and almost upon nothing without experiencing any inconvenience book advocating purely vegetable diet accidentally fell into his hands urged the pecuniary economy and the saving time adopting vegetarian diet eagerly adopted the views presented could safely had the author advocated raw onions and carrots the stomach franklin would have received them and assimilated them without any remonstrance succeeded inducing his brother relinquish one half his board and allow him board himself benjamin found that this way saved much time and much money handful raisins roll bread and glass water afforded him dinner this could dispose from five ten minutes and have the remainder the dinner hour for reading the hours the night were his own often sat late and rose early his soul all absorbed intellectual vigils there are two platforms morality some respects inseparably blended others quite distinctly separated from each other the one these platforms constitutes the low standard mere worldly morality says you must not kill you must not steal you must not lie you must not slander your neighbor you must not cheat him bargain but there another platform which not only includes all this but which introduces principles infinitely higher grade the platform enforced jesus christ essential life which shall pleasing our heavenly father our saviour says you must love god whom you live and move and have your being you must daily pray him with gratitude for the favors you receive the great conflict raging here below between sin and holiness your whole heart must yearn with the desire that god kingdom may come and that his will may done earth heaven imitating the example your saviour who was god manifest the flesh that his life might show men how live you must everything your power lead your neighbors and friends love god avoid everything thought word deed which you think will displeasing him and you must all your power prepare your heart for that world purity and love where the spirits the just are made perfect one can blind the fact that these principles are infinitely above the principles mere worldly morality they are not substitute for those principles but addition them the age sixteen franklin was disposed adopt the lower these creeds his rule life times affirming that was superior the teachings jesus christ while again there would the very clear and inconsistent avowal that this wicked world something more was needed than teachings which could plainly see seldom ever influenced lost and degraded man changed from saul tarsus paul the apostle one can understand the peculiar religious and moral character benjamin franklin

eventful journey philadelphia gloomy prospects the dawn brighter days franklin was never scrupulous the observance the sabbath still though but occasionally attended church times very earnestly urged that duty upon his young friends not probable that the preaching heard those days was calculated interest him while child under the parental roof ordinarily accompanied his parents and seemed regard his duty now however with increasing sense independence very much preferred spend his precious hours his chamber reading books which engrossed his most intense interest unfortunately many treatises fell into his hands which unchristian sentiments were conveyed his mind men the highest intellectual character and whose writings were invested with the most fascinating charms eloquence robert boyle irish nobleman wealth and fervent piety had established oxford lectureship the object which was prove the truth the christian religion these lectures had found their way tracts the little library franklin father when but fifteen years age the boy read them with far keener relish than most school boys now read the flashy novels the day order refute the arguments the deists the lecturers were bound produce those arguments fairly and forcibly but this young boy piercing mind the arguments against christianity seemed stronger than those which were brought forward refute them thus the lad became not positive unbeliever but honest doubter now sought earnestly for other works upon that all important subject the two most important influential and popular writers that day were perhaps anthony collins and the earl shaftsbury these were both men fortune polished education and great rhetorical and argumentative skill their influence over young minds was greatly increased the courtesy and candor which pervaded all their writings they ever wrote like gentlemen addressing gentlemen and the views they urged were presented with the modesty men who were earnestly seeking for the truth the main attack both these men was directed against the miracles the bible was very evident that the divine authority the bible being overthrown the whole structure the christian religion and morality must pass away parton his admirable life franklin says any one who will turn over edition shaftsbury and try read with the mind this merry and receptive printer boy will perceive how entirely captivating must have been him the raillery that was always the raillery gentleman the irony delicate really deceive some men who passed for acute the fine urbanity that pervades even the passages called severe the genuine reverence the author for virtue the spectacle revealed man uniting himself all that good sense with all that agreeable the man the world how pleasing must all have been our inky apprentice munched his noon day crust the practical creed collins and shaftsbury far can gleaned from the obscurity their brilliant pages consisted the entire renunciation all that deemed the spirituality the christian creed and the simple enforcement the ordinary principles morality man intercourse with his brother man substance they said truthful and honest not openly oppose the institutions christianity for that will render you obnoxious your neighbors conform the ordinary usages the society the midst which you move and creeds let them alone unworthy moment thought franklin sixteen years age became thorough convert these views was virtually without any god had rule life but his own instincts but those instincts were high order emboldening his character and restraining him from all vulgar vice thus wandered for many years though there are many indications occasionally troubled mind and though times struggled with great eagerness obtain higher state moral perfection certainly never developed the character warm hearted and devoted follower jesus footnote for some years wandered heathenish darkness forsook the safe and good though narrow way his forefathers and his father and mother and his gentle uncle benjamin without finding better and larger ways his own was danger becoming castaway commonplace successful man the world found due time after many trials and much suffering and many grievous errors that the soul man does not thrive upon negations and that very truth man must believe order that may saved parton life franklin vol james franklin was prosperous his business the august issued the first number newspaper entitled the new england courant benjamin set the type struck off the impression two three hundred with hand press and then traversed the streets carrying the diminutive sheet the homes the subscribers the courant soon attracted attention knot sparkling writers began contribute its columns and while the paper was with increasing eagerness sought for clamor was soon raised against was denounced radical its political tendencies and speaking contemptuously the institutions religion cotton mather even launched one his thunderbolts against wrote find notorious scandalous paper called the courant full freighted with nonsense unmanliness raillery profaneness immorality arrogance calumnies lies contradictions and what not all tending quarrels and divisions and debauch and corrupt the mind and manners new england increase mather also denounced the paper terms still more emphatic this time strong antipathy was springing between james and his apprentice brother james assumed the airs master and was arrogant and domineering times his anger proceeding even blows benjamin was opinionated headstrong and very unwilling yield another guidance benjamin compared his own compositions with those which were sent the courant was convinced that could write well not better than others therefore one evening prepared article before was sixteen years age which with the greatest care was written pure addisonian diction disguising his hand slipped this night under the door the printing office the next morning several contributors were chatting together the editorial office benjamin stood the printing case setting his types the anonymous article was read and freely commented upon the young writer was delighted finding highly commended and their guesses for the author the names the most distinguished men boston were mentioned the singular nom plume assumed was silence dogood over that signature wrote many articles before was ascertained that was the author these articles attracted much attention that young benjamin could not refrain from claiming their paternity this led his brother and others regard him with far more respect than heretofore but the courant while popular with the masses became unpopular with the governmental authorities and with the religious community slap the face the government fictitious letter was written professedly from newport stating that piratic ship had appeared off the coast plundering burning and destroying was then stated that the government massachusetts was fitting out armed vessel attack the pirate and that wind and weather permitting the vessel would sail from boston sometime during the month this reflection upon the dilatoriness government gave great offence the members the council summoned franklin before them answer for the libel admitted that was the publisher the paper but refused give the name the writer the council decided that the paragraph was high affront the government and ordered his imprisonment the boston jail here was incarcerated for week crushed his misfortunes wrote very humble letter stating that his close confinement endangered his life and begging that might enjoy the liberty the jail yard his request was granted and for three weeks more remained prisoner though with daily permission leave his cell during this time benjamin conducted the paper editing setting the type printing the sheets and distributing the copies the subscribers was still but boy sixteen james was eventually released from prison but the general character the courant remained unchanged unworthy professors christianity were incessantly assailed the virtues true christians the multitudes the disciples jesus who were mothers israel who were israelites indeed whom there was guile were forgotten while every mean and contemptible act hypocrites and apostates was proclaimed with trumpet resonance length the council declared reference peculiarly obnoxious copy the paper that the courant that date contained many passages perverting the holy scriptures and slandering the civil government the ministers and the good people the land committee three was appointed report upon the matter after two days they brought the following decision are humbly opinion that the tendency said paper mock religion and bring into contempt that the holy scriptures are therein profanely abused that the revered and faithful ministers the gospel are ignominiously reflected and that his majesty government affronted and the peace and good order his majesty subjects this province disturbed this said courant the committee therefore proposed that james franklin should strictly forbidden print publish the courant any other paper the like nature unless were supervised the secretary the province james franklin and his friends after this decision met the office the courant and adroitly decided evade the mandate canceling the indentures apprenticeship benjamin and constituting him the editor and publisher the journal this precocious lad prepared his inaugural contained the following sentiments long has the press groaned bringing forth hateful brood pamphlets malicious scribbles and billingsgate ribaldry generous and impartial person then can blame the present undertaking which designed purely for the diversion and merriment the reader pieces pleasantry and mirth have secret charm them allay the heats and tumults our spirits and make man forget his restless resentment the main design this weekly paper will entertain the town with the most comical and diverting incidents human life which large place boston will not fail universal exemplification nor shall wanting fill these papers with grateful interspersion more serious morals which may drawn from the most ludicrous and odd parts life cannot denied that franklin aimed his keen shafts many the best men who were consecrating all their energies the promotion the physical moral and religious welfare their fellow creatures had keen eye search out their frailties and though seldom ever dipped his pen gall did times succeed making them the song the drunkard and turning against them the derision all the lewd fellows the baser sort benjamin elated flattery and success admits that seventeen years age became his treatment his brother saucy and provoking james was increasingly jealous and exacting length very violent quarrel arose between them the elder brother even undertook chastise his younger brother whom still affected regard his apprentice the canceling the terms indenture regarded secret act intended merely outwit his opponent franklin burning with indignation resolved longer continue his brother employment and went several other printers boston hoping enter into new engagement but his brother had preceded him giving his own version the story and even declaring his brilliant brother infidel and atheist benjamin resolved run away for

vegetarian diet doubted our right deprive animal life for our own gratification eating the sloop was one day becalmed off block island the crew found splendid fishing ground the deck was soon covered with cod and haddock franklin denounced catching the fishes murderous one could affirm that these fishes happy the water had ever conferred any injury upon their captors but benjamin was blessed with voracious appetite the frying pan was busy and the odor from the fresh fish was exceedingly alluring watched sailor cutting open fish observed its stomach smaller fish which the cod had evidently eaten exclaimed you can eat one another surely have right eat you all his scruples vanished sat down with the rest the sumptuous repast and never after seemed have any hesitancy gratifying his appetite benjamin tells this story his autobiography and shrewdly adds quoting from some one else convenient thing reasonable creature since enables one find make reason for everything one has mind

town the place consisted but seven eight thousand inhabitants the streets were the crooked lanes which still find the vicinity the battery some the most important were uncomfortably paved with cobble

only fellow passenger the gloom the primeval forest overshadowed governor island not single cabin yet had been reared its solitudes squall struck the boat split its sail and pitched the dutchman overboard franklin caught him the hair and saved him from drowning the sudden tempest increased into storm and the boat was driven fiercely before the gale the surf dashed violently upon the shore that they could not venture land night approached exhausted drenched and hungry they cast anchor near the long island shore where bend the land afforded them slight protection while still they were great danger there were one two log cabins the vicinity several the men came the shore but could afford them relief they had provision board excepting single bottle bad rum all night long the tempest beat upon them the morning the wind had far lulled that they were enabled repair their sail and work their way amboy was late the afternoon when they reached the port for thirty hours they had been

aspect presented was shabby and dilapidated the extreme for was his working dress which the wear and tear travel had become greatly soiled and tattered was not little mortified find that the inhabitants the cabin while they treated him kindly evidently regarded him with suspicion runaway apprentice the gloom that night poor benjamin bitterly repented the step had taken and earnestly wished himself back again the home which had forsaken clouds and darkness had gathered around his path and could see but little bright beyond early the next morning resumed his travels pressing

woman burlington was the east side the river philadelphia was the west there was road between the two places the communication being the river only seemed impossible for benjamin toil that distance through the pathless tangled forest had but five shillings his pocket with the utmost economy that would not defray his expenses burlington for three days and leave sufficient sum pay his passage down the river his distress and perplexity our young philosopher whose renown for wisdom subsequently filled all christian lands turned back the poor aged woman whom had bought his gingerbread and solicited her advice the good old soul not insensible the charms the frank and manly looking boy with motherly tenderness insisted his going her own humble home gladly accepted the invitation the dinner consisted what called cheek franklin contributed pot beer walking out early the evening upon the banks the river found his great joy chance boat had come along bound philadelphia and containing

franklin tried dissuade him from his folly but vain one occasion they all agreed attempt version the eighteenth psalm this sublime production inspired pen contains fifty verses imagery grand and sentiments beautiful perhaps can anywhere else found within the same compass any language certainly speaks well for the intellectual acumen these young men and for their devotional instincts that they should have selected noble theme their main object was improve themselves the command language and the power expression they could not have chosen subject more appropriate than the psalmist

conferred with denham judicious friend whose acquaintance had made board the ship they ascertained that the infamous governor from motives which difficult comprehend had not furnished franklin with single document there was not bill credit single letter introduction commending the young adventurer people london denham then told him that one who knew keith had the slightest confidence his promises that the idea that would furnish him with any letters credit was preposterous since sir william had credit with any body and thus franklin found himself with his companion james ralph alone the great world london without any letters introduction without any prospect employment and almost without money the virtues franklin had exerted restraining influence upon the unprincipled ralph and

there were prospects his advancement this consideration addition his desire escape from london led him accept the offer was now twenty years age does not appear that had thus far formed any deliberate plan for his life work floated along the current events drifted him the twenty first july franklin embarked board the ship berkshire for philadelphia had been absent from america but little more than year and half during this time had not increased his fortune for had spent his money fast had earned after voyage eighty days the ship cast anchor before philadelphia that time ships were often from three seven months effecting the passage across the atlantic usual franklin kept diary punctually during his long voyage its pages were replete with pithy remarks wit and wisdom was very fond game checkers and that amusement beguiled many weary hours find the following striking comments upon the diversion his journal game much delight but requires clear head and undisturbed the persons playing they would play well ought not much regard the consequences the game for that diverts and withdraws the mind from the game itself and makes the player liable make many false open moves will venture lay down for infallible rule that two persons equal judgment play for considerable sum that loves money most shall lose his anxiety for the success the game confounds him courage almost requisite for the good conduct this game real battle for the player imagines himself opposed one that much his superior skill his mind intent the defensive part that advantage passes unobserved the governor the isle wight had died leaving the reputation having been one the most consummate scoundrels who ever exercised despotic power franklin his treatise upon liberty and necessity written but few months before had assumed that there was such thing good and evil that god ordered and controlled every event and that consequently every event was accordance with his will and alike pleasing his sight but now find the following record his journal which most readers will recognize inconsistent with the young philosopher theological opinions writes the death this governor appeared that was great villain and great politician there was crime damnable which would stick the execution his designs and yet had the art covering all thick that with almost all men general while lived passed for saint short believe impossible for man though has all the cunning devil live and die villain and yet conceal well carry the name honest fellow the grave with him but some one some accident other shall discover

that the acquaintance was ever resumed the governor lived nearly twenty five years afterward dishonored and ruined man and died the extreme poverty poor miss read heart broken and deeming herself forever abandoned yielded the importunities her friends and married mechanic the name rogers proved thoroughly worthless fellow his unconcealed profligacy and unfaithfulness his wife compelled her

another wife franklin entered upon his duties clerk denham with his accustomed energy and skill carried into his new vocation all his intellectual sagacity and speedily won not only the confidence but the affection his employer lived with denham and being always disposed look upon the bright side everything even his own imperfections notwithstanding his infidelity miss read seems have been very happy and even jovial young man four months after franklin had entered upon his mercantile career both denham and franklin were seized with the pleurisy denham died franklin though brought near the grave recovered writes suffered great deal gave the point own mind and was the time rather disappointed when found myself recovering regretting some degree that must now sometime other have all that disagreeable work over again the death denham broke the establishment and franklin was thrown out employment keimer whose service had formerly been engaged again made him offer superintend printing office franklin accepted the proposition there were five inefficient hands whom franklin was expected transform into accomplished printers with these and few others organized literary club called the junto the leathern apron club nearly every member was mechanic the club met every friday evening and the wine cup stimulate conviviality passed freely among them there were twenty four questions which were every evening read which answers were returned any one who could answer them between each question was expected that each member would fill and empty his glass one would think that the wine must have been very weak the heads these young men very strong enable them quaff twenty four glasses unharmed give few the questions specimens their general character have you met with anything the author you last read has any citizen your knowledge failed and have you heard the cause what unhappy effects intemperance have you lately observed has any deserving stranger arrived town since your last meeting has anybody attacked your reputation lately there any difficulty which you would gladly have discussed this time debates declamation and the reading essays added the entertainment these gatherings stories were told and bacchanal songs sung man could tell better story and few men could sing better song than benjamin franklin one was deemed suitable member the club who would not contribute his full quota the entertainment instruction the questions proposed franklin for discussion developed the elevated intellectual region his thoughts were accustomed range give few specimens can any one particular form government suit all mankind should the aim philosophy eradicate the passions perfection attainable this life what general conduct life most suitable for men such circumstances most the members the junto are the junto was limited twelve members soon became popular that applications for admission became very frequent six months passed rapidly away when keimer who was exceedingly immoral and worthless man and was fast going ruin some fit drunkenness ungovernable irritation entered the office and assailed franklin with such abuse that took his hat and repaired his lodgings resolved never return franklin was twenty one years age had laid money was still but journeyman printer the draft which had received from vernon for fifty dollars had not yet

had behaved ralph mistress vernon and miss read whose young life had been blighted through him footnote parton life franklin vol franklin creed thus far consisted only negations had belief had only unbelief indeed seems have become quite ashamed his treatise upon liberty and necessity published london and felt constrained write refutation this strange young man his discontent looked over the religions the world could find one that met his views therefore deliberately and thoughtfully sat down form religion his own many such persons have appeared the lapse the ages and almost invariably they have announced their creeds with the words thus saith the lord but our young printer twenty two years made profession whatever any divine aid simply said thus saith thoughts one would think could not have much confidence those thoughts when remembered that this time was writing refutation the opinions which had published london but few months before footnote arguments perverted some others especially collins and ralph but each these having wronged greatly without the least compunction and recollecting keith conduct towards who was another free thinker and own towards vernon and miss read which times gave great trouble began suspect that this doctrine though might true was not very useful london pamphlet printed and which had for its motto whatever right and which from the attributes god his infinite wisdom goodness and power concluded that nothing could possibly wrong the world and that vice and virtue were empty distinctions such things existing appeared now not clever performance once thought and doubted whether some error had not insinuated itself unperceived into argument the year franklin wrote benjamin vaughn respecting this pamphlet there were only one hundred copies printed which gave few friends afterwards disliking the piece burnt the rest except one copy was not nineteen years age when was written wrote piece the other side the question which began with laying for its foundation that almost all men all ages and countries have times made use prayer thence reasoned that all things are ordained prayer must among the rest ordained but prayer can procure change things that are ordained praying must then useless and absurdity god would therefore not ordain praying everything else was ordained but praying exists therefore all other things are not ordained this manuscript was never printed the great uncertainty found metaphysical reasoning disgusted and quitted that kind reading and study for others more satisfactory autobiography the book which franklin thus prepared was entitled articles belief and acts religion his simple creed was that there was one supreme god who had created many minor gods that the supreme god was great that did not desire the worship man but was far above the minor gods are perhaps immortal and perhaps after the ages lapse they are changed others supplying their place each these subordinate gods has created for himself sun with its planetary system over which presides and from the inhabitants which expects adoration writes that particular wise and good god who the author and owner our system that propose for the object praise and adoration inferred that this god not above caring for pleased with our praise and offended when slight him then prepares invocation this god our solar system founded the style the psalms but immeasurably inferior most those sublime utterances the psalmist israel and still the sentiments breathed were ennobling their character they proved that franklin was vastly superior the thoughtless reckless deists who surrounded him and that his soul was reaching forth and yearning for higher and holier attainments this invocation the whole which cannot quote writes creator father believe that thou art good and that thou art pleased with the pleasure thy children praised thy name forever thy power thou hast made the glorious sun with his attending worlds thy wisdom thou hast formed all things thy wisdom thy power and thy goodness are everywhere clearly seen thou abhorrest thy creatures treachery and deceit malice revenge intemperance and every other hurtful vice but thou art lover justice and sincerity friendship and benevolence and every virtue thou art friend father and benefactor praised thy name god forever amen the prayer which followed doubtless giving utterance his most inward feelings beautiful inasmuch wrote reason our ignorance cannot certain that many things which often hear mentioned the petitions men the deity would prove real goods they were our possession and have reason hope and believe that the goodness heavenly father will not withhold from suitable share temporal blessings virtuous and holy life conciliate his favor and kindness therefore presume not ask such things but rather humbly and with sincere heart express earnest desire that would graciously assist continual endeavors and resolutions eschewing vice and embracing virtue which kind supplication will the same time remind solemn manner extensive duty then added the supplication that might preserved from atheism impiety and profaneness that might loyal his prince that might gracious those below him that might refrain from calumny and detraction that might sincere friendship just his dealings grateful his benefactors patient affliction that might have tenderness for the weak and that rejoicing the good others might become truly virtuous and magnanimous very evident that some unexplained circumstances had called the attention franklin very earnestly the subject religion wrote very much upon that theme and published new version the lord prayer and lecture upon providence and predestination however admits that very seldom attended any public worship adding had still opinion its propriety and its utility when rightly conducted and regularly paid annual subscription for the support the only presbyterian minister rumors soon

religion has always suffered when orthodoxy more regarded than virtue and the scriptures assure that the last day shall not examined what thought but what did franklin having revealed religion guide him and having foundation for his faith but the ever changing vagaries his own fantastic imagination could have belief day which had any certainty that would hold the same morrow was continually abandoning one after another the articles his fantastical creed and adopting others their place length settled down upon the following simple belief which with very considerable tenacity but without any attempt promulgate adhered for many years consisted the six following articles which give briefest language there one god governs the world ought worshipped doing good the service most acceptable him man immortal the future world the souls men will dealt with justly very evident that franklin had great confidence his theological opinions studiously avoided all writing upon the subject and far possible all conversation still with his keen sense humor could not refrain from occasionally plunging pretty sharp dagger thrust into the palpable imperfections the various and contending sects there was very little moral power the creed professed arrest young men glowing passions and exposed the most difficult temptations their downward career voice franklin was heard with potency calling upon those who were thronging the broad road lecture upon providence his companions the junto which was subsequently published and which reflects some considerable honor upon the earnestness his thoughts wrote especially discouraged when reflect that you are all intimate pot companions who have heard say thousand silly things conversation and therefore have not that laudable partiality and veneration

meredith the genius franklin was immediately displayed the improved literary character the paper and its mechanical execution the name was changed the pennsylvania gazette the first number issued him was oct the subject religion was almost entirely ignored franklin seems have become weary the darkness and the fogs through which his unillumined mind had been long painfully floundering without coming any results upon which could place reliance christianity generally treated with respect though could not refrain from occasionally giving sly thrust those imperfections christians which were palpable his observant mind and though never assailed that which was not inherently bad cannot denied that occasionally his keen sarcasms brought christianity itself into reproach were religion which produced better fruits perhaps not good religion all the business this young firm franklin and meredith viewed the light the grand printing enterprises the present day was indeed trivial the two young men did all the work themselves without even boy help them fact meredith who the best was poor workman and who fell into intemperate habits neglected his business frequented the ale houses and left all responsibility resting upon the efficient shoulders his partner franklin who endeavored perfect every thing undertook printed his paper admirably that said that there probably not journal now

investigation took place which was compelled acknowledge that had stolen every one his sermons franklin writes this detection gave many our party disgust who accordingly abandoned his cause and occasioned our more speedy discomfiture the synod stuck him however rather approved his giving good sermons composed others than bad ones his own though the latter was the practice our common teachers had the young man said frankly rehearsing you the most eloquent sermons the most eloquent english divines one could have found any fault but for him assume that the sermons were his own and that personally was entitled the credit whatever power they exhibited was certainly practicing deception was gross violation franklin cardinal virtue sincerity was unworthy franklin his charitable regard for the offender gloss over the real criminality the offence year after franklin marriage son was born him whom gave the name francis folger franklin all accounts agree describing the child endowed with remarkable beauty and intelligence probably franklin never loved any being loved that child the year when this wonderful boy was but four years age was seized with the small pox and died even the philosophic franklin was almost crushed the terrible calamity the cheering views the christian faith could not sustain him had vivid conception his cherub boy angel heaven awaiting his father arrival could only say that inclined believe that child has not passed away into utter annihilation but who knows many the wisest and best earth utterly discard the idea future existence they deem the thought the conceit ignorance and fanaticism read the following epitaph his little grave stone with much sympathy for the bereaved father could only write francis son benjamin and deborah franklin deceased november aged four years one month and one day the delight all who knew him the year rev george whitefield arrived philadelphia remarkable that warm friendship should have sprung between men very diverse character but franklin could not insensible the wonderful power this preacher promoting public morals and transforming the worst men into valuable citizens faithfully performing all the duties life surprising that this effect the gospel did not teach him that christianity the wisdom god and the power god salvation love was emphatically the message which whitefield with tearful eyes and throbbing heart proclaimed the wicked and the sorrowing god loved the world that gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth him should not perish but should have everlasting life christ came not into the world condemn the world but that the world through him might saved such were the themes which this apostolic preacher unfolded and which moved human hearts these new colonies seventeen hundred years ago they were moved the preaching our lord jesus christ and his disciple paul upon the plains asia whitefield taught that belief controlled conduct man sincerely believes will act franklin with his accustomed candor his autobiography wrote the following terms the effects the preaching this remarkable reformer the multitudes all sects and denominations that attended his sermons were enormous was wonderful see the change soon made the manners our inhabitants from being thoughtless indifferent about religion seemed all the world were growing religious that one could not walk through the town evening without hearing psalms sung different families every street whitefield leaving went preaching all the way through the colonies georgia the settlement that province had been lately begun but instead being made with hardy industrious husbandmen accustomed labor the only people fit for such enterprise was with families broken shop keepers and other insolvent debtors many indolent and idle habits taken out the jails who being set down the woods unqualified for clearing land and unable endure the hardships new settlement perished numbers leaving many helpless children unprovided for the sight their miserable situation inspired the benevolent heart whitefield with the idea building orphan house there which they might supported and educated returning northward preached this charity and made large collections did not disapprove the design but georgia was then destitute materials and workmen and was proposed send them from philadelphia great expense thought would have been better have built the house philadelphia and brought the children this advised but was resolute his first project rejected counsel and therefore refused contribute happened soon after attend one his sermons the course which perceived intended finish with collection and silently resolved should get nothing from had pocket handful copper money three four silver dollars and five pistoles gold about twenty five dollars proceeded began soften and concluded give the copper another stroke his oratory made ashamed that and determined give the silver and finished admirably that emptied pockets wholly into the collector dish gold and all some whitefield enemies affected suppose that would apply these collections his own private emolument but who was intimately acquainted with him being employed printing his sermons and journals never had the least suspicion his integrity but this day decidedly the opinion that was all his conduct perfectly honest man and methinks testimony ought have the more weight had religious connection used indeed sometimes pray for conversion but never had the satisfaction believing that his prayers were heard ours was friendship sincere both sides and lasted his death footnote autobiography franklin given sparks one time franklin wrote whitefield boston inviting him was about come philadelphia make his house his home the devout preacher replied you make this offer for christ sake you will not lose your reward promptly the philosopher rejected any such motive and rejoined not mistaken was not for christ sake invited you but for your own sake all the numerous letters essays and philosophical and religious disquisitions franklin seldom think find sentiment indicative any high appreciation the character jesus christ the debt gratitude owe him either for his teaching for his example franklin discarded all idea the atonement course could not express any gratitude for that which the christian the crowning act even divine love this saviour millions who cannot counted has proved even the comfort delusion temptation disappointment and death more precious than the power words declare one article from franklin newspaper published the year gives idea the extraordinary interest which the preaching whitefield excited thursday last the reverend whitefield left this city and was accompanied chester about one hundred and fifty horse and preached there about seven thousand people friday preached twice willings town about five thousand saturday newcastle about two thousand five hundred and the same evening christiana bridge about three thousand sunday white clay creek preached twice resting about half hour between the sermons eight thousand whom three thousand computed came horseback rained most the time and yet they stood the open air the keenness the scrutiny with which franklin watched all the operations nature led him the discovery the before unknown fact that the fierce north east storms which sweep our atlantic coast invariably begin the south west and move backwards diminishing violence they also about this time invented the franklin stove which the day when wood was the only fuel consumed has invested many firesides with rare aspect cheerfulness wrote very ingenious pamphlet elucidating the philosophy house warming there great moral power prosperity when wisely accepted and enjoyed

consequence the troubled times the tract was not published until the year was entitled proposals relating the education youth pennsylvania the suggestions presented indicated wide acquaintance with the writings the most eminent philosophers marked out minutely and with great wisdom the course study pursued pleasant read the following statement this programme urging the study history writes history will also afford frequent opportunities showing the necessity public religion from its usefulness the public the advantages religious character among private persons the mischiefs superstition and the excellency the christian religion above all others ancient and modern perhaps this tribute the excellence christianity ought some degree modify the impression left upon the mind franklin studious avoidal all his writings any allusion the name jesus christ its founder twenty five thousand dollars were speedily raised for this institution all the religious sects harmoniously united one individual from each sect was appointed form the corporate body intrusted with the funds but almost the entire care and trouble rearing the building and organizing the institution fell upon franklin was found fully adequate all these responsibilities chapter vii the tradesman becomes philosopher franklin appointed indian commissioner effects rum indian logic accumulating honors benevolent

rejected electrical experiments franklin increase income fearful experiments the kite new honors views the french philosopher franklin religious views his counsel young pleader post office reforms the year franklin then forty four years age was appointed commission form treaty with the indians carlisle franklin knowing the frenzy which the savages were plunged intoxication promised them that they would keep entirely sober until the treaty was concluded they should then have ample supply rum the agreement was made and faithfully kept they then writes franklin claimed and received the rum this was the afternoon they were near one hundred men women and children and were lodged temporary cabins built the form square just without the town the evening hearing great noise among them the commissioners walked see what was the matter found that they had made great bonfire the middle the square that they were all drunk men and women quarreling and fighting their dark colored bodies half naked seen only the gloomy light the bonfire running after and beating one another with firebrands accompanied their horrid yellings formed scene the most resembling our ideas hell that could well imagined there was appeasing the tumult and returned our lodgings midnight number them came thundering our door demanding more rum which took notice the next morning they all seemed very much ashamed the disgraceful orgies which they had indulged there was law written their own hearts which told them that they had done wrong three chiefs were appointed call upon the commissioners with humble apology with downcast looks they confessed their fault and then with logic which more intelligent men sometimes use endeavored throw the blame upon god remarkable speech one them said the great spirit who made all things made everything for some use whatever use designed anything for that use should always put now when made rum said let this for the indians get drunk with and must the governor this time appointed franklin justice peace franklin says was much flattered these accumulating honors soon was elected seat one the legislators the assembly mainly through his influence hospital for the sick was established philadelphia though the measure encountered much opposition carried and the institution proved incalculable benefit the rev gilbert tennent solicited franklin aid raising money for building meeting house franklin had been continually engaged asking for money for various objects benevolence was afraid should become obnoxious his fellow citizens and declined tennent then requested him give him list the names those influential persons upon whom would well for him call every christian minister who reads this will appreciate the nature his embarrassment franklin says that thought would unbecoming him after having emptied the purses his friends send other beggars them with renewed importunities this request therefore declined tennent then urged him give him some advice franklin replied that will willingly the first place advise you apply all those who you know will something next those who you are uncertain whether they will give anything not and show them the list those who have given and lastly not neglect those who you are sure will give nothing for some them you may mistaken tennent laughed heartily and declared that would rigorously follow out this advice did his success was wonderful much larger sum was raised than had anticipated and soon capacious and beautiful meeting house rose arch street the streets philadelphia though laid out with great regularity were unpaved and wet weather were almost impassable quagmires franklin talking with his friends and urging the subject his paper length succeeded having sidewalk paved with stone upon one the most important streets gave great satisfaction but the rest the street not being paved the mud was thrown passing carriages upon and the city employed street cleaners the sidewalk soon ceased afford clean passage pedestrians franklin found industrious man who was willing sweep the pavement twice week carrying off the dirt from before all the doors for the sum sixpence month paid each house the philosophic franklin then having started this enterprise printed sheet paper the great advantages keeping the sidewalk clean and sent one these papers each house urged that much the soiling the interior the houses would thus avoided that attractive sidewalk would lure passengers the shops and that windy weather their goods would preserved from the dust after few days called person each house and shop see who would subscribe sixpence month was great success the cleanliness the pavement the important streets surrounding the market greatly delighted the people and prepared the way for carrying bill which franklin presented the assembly for paving and lighting all the important streets the city gentleman the name john clifton had placed lamp before his door this suggested the idea lamps were sent for from london globes were furnished they were expensive the smoke circulated the globe and obstructed the light they had wiped clean each day accidental stroke demolished the whole globe franklin suggested four flat panes one might broken and easily replaced crevices were left below admit current air and funnel draw off the smoke thus for long time the glass remained undimmed wherever franklin went carried with him this spirit improvement when london found the streets wretchedly dirty one morning found poor woman his door craven street sweeping the sidewalk with wretched broom her pallid and exhausted appearance touched the sympathies franklin asked who employed her she replied nobody poor and distress sweeps before gentlefolks doors and hopes they will give something franklin immediately engaged her sweep the whole street was nine clock the morning she was languid and debilitated that thought would take her nearly all day but three hours she came for her shilling franklin thought she could not have done her work faithfully sent his servant examine reported that the work was thoroughly done new problem rose before franklin this feeble woman could short time sweep such street strong man with suitable broom could certainly half the time therefore drew plan for cleaning the streets london and westminster which was placed the hands one the most influential the public spirited men london franklin apologizes for speaking his autobiography such trifles very truly says human felicity produced not much great pieces good fortune that seldom happen little advantages that occur every day thus you teach poor young man shave himself and keep his razor order you may contribute more the happiness his life than giving him thousand guineas this sum may soon spent the regret only remaining having foolishly consumed but the other case escapes the frequent vexation waiting for barbers and their sometimes dirty fingers offensive breath and dull razors shaves when most convenient him and enjoys daily the pleasure its being done with good instrument nearly all the important offices the colonies were filled appointments from the british crown for some time franklin had been employed assistant the postmaster general simplifying and bringing regularity into his accounts upon the death the american postmaster franklin was appointed jointly with sir william hunter succeed him the appointment was made the postmaster general england the post office department had scarcely been self supporting had never paid anything the crown the salary offered the two postmasters was three thousand dollars year each they could save that sum from the profits the office franklin writes this variety improvements was necessary some these were inevitably first expensive that the first four years the office became above nine hundred pounds debt but soon after began repay and before was displaced freak the ministers which shall hereafter speak had brought yield three times much clear revenue the crown the post office ireland since that imprudent transaction they have received from not one farthing again there were menaces war insane and demoniac fill the world with tears and woe read the record these horrid outrages which through all the centuries have desolated this globe would seem that there must vein insanity well depravity the heart fallen man england and france were again marshaling their armies and accumulating their fleets for the terrible conflict was certain that france canada and england her colonies could not live peace here while the volcanic throes war were shaking the island great britain and the continent europe the heart new york then almost unbroken wilderness there were six exceedingly fierce and war like tribes called the six nations like the wolves they delighted war the greatness man depended the number scalps with which could fringe his dress these savage warriors were ready and eager engage the allies those who would pay them the highest price mercy was attribute which they knew not even the name was not doubted that france would immediately send her emissaries from canada enlist these savages her side awful would the woes with which these demoniac men could sweep our defenceless frontiers with the tomahawk and the scalping knife exterminating families burning villages and loading their pack horses with plunder forestall the french and turn these woes from our own frontier the humble homes the canadian emigrants the english government appointed commissioner visit the chiefs these tribes the year the all important council was held albany governor hamilton appointed four commissioners whom franklin was one act behalf pennsylvania they were furnished with rich gifts with which purchase the favor the indians was long and tedious journey from philadelphia albany franklin this journey was deeply impressed with the importance union the colonies for self defence therefore drew plan for such union several gentlemen the highest intelligence new york having examined gave their cordial approval accordingly laid before congress there were several other persons other colonies who were impressed deeply franklin with sense the importance such confederacy and they also sent their suggestions congress appointed committee one from each province consider the several plans the committee approved franklin plan and reported accordingly while the commissioners were conferring with the indians albany congress was engaged discussing the plans confederacy franklin plan was finally rejected did not meet the views either the assembly the british court and here see perhaps the germs the great conflict which soon culminated the cruel war the revolution the assembly objected the plan too aristocratic conferring too much power upon the crown the court emphatically rejected too democratic investing the people with too much power franklin ever affirmed that his plan was the true medium even the royalist governor pennsylvania warmly commended the compromise urged visiting boston was shown electric tube recently sent from england with this tube some very surprising electrical experiments were performed ushering new science which then but very little was known franklin became intensely interested the subject upon his return philadelphia devoted himself with great assiduity experimenting with electric tubes this time wrote friend never was before engaged any study that totally engrossed attention and time this has lately done for what with making experiments when can alone and repeating them friends and acquaintances who from the novelty the thing come continually crowds see them have little leisure for anything else this was during the winter franklin suggested that the electricity was collected not created friction also propounded the theory positive and negative electricity was this time comparatively wealthy man and consequently could afford devote his time philosophical investigation estimated that his income from his estates amounted about seven hundred pounds year this was equal about six seven thousand dollars the present time parton writes besides this independence franklin was the holder two offices worth together perhaps one hundred and fifty pounds year his business then more flourishing than ever produced annual profit before computed two thousand pounds bringing his income the troublesome and absurd amount nearly three thousand pounds three times the revenue colonial governor under these prosperous circumstances franklin withdrew from active business became silent partner the firm and devoted nearly all his time the new science wrote the autumn his friend cadwallader colden new york have removed more quiet part the town where settling old accounts and hope soon quite master own time and longer the song has every one call but own thus you see fair way having other tasks than such shall like give myself and enjoying what look upon great happiness leisure read study make experiments and converse large with such ingenious and worthy men are pleased honor with their friendship acquaintance such points may produce something for the common benefit mankind uninterrupted the cares and fatigues business wrote treatise upon thundergusts which displayed wonderful sagacity and which arrested the attention nearly all the philosophers europe and america the all important topics this exceedingly important document were the power points draw off electricity and also the similarity electricity and lightning therefore urged that metallic rods might attached buildings and ships which pushing their needle points above roofs and masts might draw the electric fire harmlessly from the clouds confesses that cannot imagine why the points should possess this curious power but urges that facts seem demonstrate one day for the entertainment his friends had made arrangements kill turkey with electric shock two large jars were heavily charged incautiously manipulating took the shock himself the following language describes the effect the flash was very great and the crack was loud pistol yet senses being instantly gone neither saw the one nor heard the other nor did feel the stroke hand though afterwards found raised round swelling where the fire entered big half pistol bullet then felt what know not well how describe universal blow throughout whole body from head foot which seemed within well without after which the first thing took notice was violent quick shaking body which gradually remitting sense gradually returned and then thought the bottle must discharged but could not conceive how till last perceived the chain hand and recollected what had been about that part hand and fingers which held the chain was left white though the blood had been driven out and remained eight ten minutes after feeling like dead flesh and had numbness arms and the back neck which continued the next morning but wore off franklin was much mortified his awkwardness this experiment declared notorious blunder and compared with the folly the irishman who wishing steal some gun powder bored hole through the cask with red hot iron but notwithstanding this warning not long afterwards endeavoring give shock paralytic patient received the whole charge himself and was knocked flat and senseless the floor the spring franklin tried his world renowned experiment with the kite june thunder cloud was rising all its majesty franklin accompanied his son repaired field secretly being afraid the ridicule the people here raised the kite made large silk handkerchief the top the perpendicular stick was pointed with sharp metallic rod the string was hemp with the exception the part held the hand which was silk the end the hempen string common key was suspended with intense anxiety and slight apprehension danger held the line soon observed the fibres the hempen string rise and separate themselves was the case the hair the head when any one was placed insulating stool applied his knuckle the key and received unmistakable spark the story generally told with occasionally slight contradictions applied his knuckle again and again the key with similar result charged leyden jar with the fluid and both and his son took shock then drew his kite packed his apparatus and returned his laboratory probably the most exultant and happy man this wide world most the english and many the french philosophers were very unwilling believe that obscure american what they deemed the savage and uncultivated wilds the new world was outstripping them philosophical research they were unwilling acknowledge the reality his experiments but france where american would receive more impartial treatment three the most eminent philosophers count buffon dalibard and lor different places raised the apparatus franklin had recommended draw electricity from the clouds their success was unmistakable the results these experiments were proclaimed throughout europe franklin had now obtained renown one could deny that merited high position among the most eminent philosophers the experiments had suggested were tried scientists the philosophical circles every country europe both yale and harvard this country conferred upon him the honorary degree master arts and the royal society europe unanimous vote elected him member remitting the usual initiation fee five guineas and the annual charge two and half guineas the next year this society conferred upon him the copley medal for seven years franklin continued devote himself almost exclusively this science and became without doubt the most accomplished electrician the world the same time his mind was ever active devising new schemes for the welfare humanity the most trivial events would often suggest him measures conducive the most beneficial results said that franklin saw one day ditch the fragments basket yellow willow which some foreign commodity had been imported this country one the twigs had sprouted planted and became the parent all the yellow willows our country franklin was best loved where was best known and this was right for was ever conferring deeds kindness upon his neighbors his religious views excited sorrow among his christian friends others composing perhaps majority cared nothing about what believed conversation ever frankly avowed himself deist though generally made attempt convert others his views not improbable that was some degree influenced the beneficial effect produced upon the popular mind the preaching his friend whitefield the writer was once paris conversing with one the most illustrious the french philosophers said the philosopher much interested ascertain the views gentlemen your intellectual position respecting the christian religion with perfect frankness replied think that there are men high culture france with few exceptions who believe the divine origin christianity but there philanthropist who will say have been taught the horrors the french revolution that the masses the people can only restrained from violence the superstitious restraints which christianity presents therefore think that every man who gentleman will what can sustain the church and the clergy men culture and refinement are governed principles honor and they not need the superstitious motives christianity influence them may remark passing that this gentlemanly philosopher had abandoned his own wife and was then living with the wife another man not improbable that franklin looked upon the tumultuous and passion tossed young men philadelphia did not deem expedient say them the bible fable the sabbath more sacred than any other day the church merely human club without any divine authority marriage institution which not founded upon any decree which god has issued but one the expediency which each individual must judge for himself the sacraments baptism and the lord supper are mere human contrivances the preaching the gospel had better laid aside for literary and scientific disquisitions with the eye benevolent philosopher franklin have seen had watched the effect the preaching whitefield and had candidly acknowledged its power reforming society improbable that his heart felt that the preaching pure deism could ever secure such results wrote whitefield reply communication from him upon the christian faith the faith you mention certainly has its use the world not desire see diminished nor would endeavor lessen any man franklin had resolved decline all office that might devote himself his studies but his reputation for wisdom was such that found very difficult persevere this plan menaces war were continually arising the majority the members the assembly were quakers was small body consisting but forty delegates the quakers opposed every measure for public defence franklin have mentioned became justice the peace soon after was alderman and then took his seat the general assembly was bad speaker writes never eloquent subject much hesitation the choice words and yet generally carried point adds language which every young man should treasure his memory retained the habit expressing myself terms modest diffidence never using when advanced anything that might possibly disputed the words certainly undoubtedly any others that give the air positiveness opinion but rather conceive apprehend thing and appears should not think for such and such reasons imagine not mistaken this habit believe has been great advantage when have had occasion inculcate opinions and persuade men into measures that have been from time time proposing when franklin assumed the charge the post office the department was feeble and peculiar condition late the year the mail bag virginia was passed from planter planter each one was required forward promptly under the penalty forfeiting hogshead tobacco every man took from the bag what belonged his family and sent the rest the line post offices then extended from boston mass charleston was twenty years after this before any governmental mail penetrated the interior the year franklin visited every post office excepting that charleston his wisdom introduced reforms some which have continued the present day newspaper was charged nine pence year for distance fifty miles and eighteen pence for one hundred miles more the large towns penny post was established and all letters left remaining the office were advertised mail was conveyed from philadelphia new york once week summer and once two weeks winter franklin started mail leave each these cities three times week summer and twice winter generally required six weeks obtain answer from letter sent boston most the roads into the

gained strength the higher circles philadelphia some the more opulent families planned for series dancing entertainments during the winter was proposed among other rules that mechanic mechanic wife daughter should invited the rules were shown franklin glanced his eye over them and pithily remarked why these rules would exclude god almighty how inquired the manager because franklin replied the almighty all know the greatest mechanic the universe six days made all things the obnoxious article was stricken out the following incident narrated franklin illustrates very important principle political economy which those are apt ignore who denounce all the elegancies and luxuries life mrs franklin received some small favor from the captain little coaster which ran between cape may and philadelphia declined receive any remuneration for his trifling services mrs franklin learning that had pretty daughter sent her new fashioned philadelphia cap bonnet three years after the captain called again the house franklin very plain but intelligent farmer accompanied him the captain expressed his thanks mrs franklin for the gift she had sent his daughter and rather discourteously added but proved dear cap our congregation when daughter appeared with meeting was much admired that all the girls resolved get such caps from philadelphia and wife and computed that the whole could not have cost less than hundred pounds the farmer with far higher intelligence said this true but you not tell the whole story think the cap was nevertheless advantage was the first thing that put our girls upon knitting worsted mittens for sale philadelphia that they might have wherewithal buy caps and ribbons there and you know that that industry has continued and likely continue and increase much greater value and answer better purposes thus profitable exchange the industrious girls cape may had pretty bonnets and the girls philadelphia had warm mittens for seventy five years had been the constant design the british government drive the french from north america england claimed the whole country from the atlantic the pacific because her ships had first sailed along the atlantic coast was one the recognized laws nations that newly discovered region belonged the nation who had first raised upon its flag france admitting the claim england the atlantic coast asserted her right the great valleys the interior those the ohio and the mississippi because her boatmen had first discovered those magnificent rivers had explored them throughout and had established upon them her trading and military posts was recognized law nations that the power which discovered explored and took possession new river was the rightful possessor the valley which that river watered thus the conflict claims originated add the intensity the insane strife which caused amount blood and misery which tongue can tell religious bitterness was aroused and the french roman catholic was arrayed against the british protestant three wars bloody and woful had already ravaged this continent have before alluded the menace new war the year and franklin mission albany enlist the chiefs the six nations become allies the english have also alluded the plan which franklin drew this journey for the union the colonies and which was rejected the wisdom this plan was however subsequently developed the fact that was remarkably like that which eventually the colonies were bound together nation assuming that the english were right their claim for the whole continent franklin urged the eminently wise measure establishing strong colonies villages hundred families each the luxuriant banks the western rivers but the haughty british government would receive instructions from american provincials governor shirley boston showed franklin plan drawn england for conducting the war developed consummate ignorance the difficulties carrying war the pathless wilderness and also great disregard the political rights the american citizens according this document the british court was originate and execute all the measures for the conduct the war and the british parliament was assess whatever tax deemed expedient upon the american people defray the expenses the americans were have representation parliament and voice whatever deciding upon the sum which they were pay franklin examined the document carefully and returned with his written objections this remarkable paper anticipated the arguments which our most distinguished statesmen and logicians urged against the stamp act against taxation without representation brief extract from this important paper will give the reader some idea its character the colonists are englishmen the accident living colony deprives them right secured magna charta the people the colonies who are feel the immediate mischiefs invasion and conquest enemy the loss their estates lives and liberties are likely better judges the quantity forces necessary raised and maintained and supported and their own ability bear the expense than the parliament england great distance compelling the colonists pay money without their consent would rather like raising contributions enemy country than taxing englishmen for their own public benefit would treating them conquered people and not true british subjects length the brave but self conceited and haughty general braddock came with his army british regulars frenchmen indians and americans alike regarded with contempt his troops were rendezvoused fredericktown maryland bridle path led through the wilderness this place from philadelphia distance hundred and twenty miles intelligent american gentlemen were much alarmed the reckless and perilous measures which the ignorant british general declared his intention pursue became very angry with pennsylvanians because they were unwilling fall with his plans was said that his anger manifested more desire ravage pennsylvania than defeat the french the assembly philadelphia appointed commission consisting benjamin franklin and his son resolute insubordinate man thirty years and the governors new york and massachusetts visit the arrogant british officer and endeavor some way influence him wiser measures was the middle april beautiful season that climate swelling buds and opening leaves each the four gentlemen was attended servants was customary those days they were all finely mounted joyfully they rode along seeking entertainment each night the residence some planter courier was always sent forward announce their coming and the planter accompanied one two his servants would generally ride forward few miles meet them and escort them his hospitable home franklin was received gen braddock with the condescension with which that day english gentlemen were ever accustomed regard americans whatever name note the little army which was march upon fort duquesne was traverse the dreary and pathless ridges and ravines the alleghany mountains and force their way through tangled wilderness for distance several hundred miles during all this march they were hourly exposed attacked overpowering force french and indians the french could easily descend the ohio their boats from canada and nearly all the indians this vast interior were alliance with them braddock insisted upon encumbering his march with heavily laden wagons which were penetrate savage regions through which must every mile construct his road there was young american the camp the name george washington was man the highest rank and commanding influence having obtained much experience indian warfare modestly but warmly remonstrated against this folly not only feared but was fully assured that such measure would lead the inevitable destruction the army urged that pack horses only should employed and few them possible and that thus they should hurry along rapidly and compact mass they could but braddock was inexorable demanded his two hundred and fifty wagons and large train pack horses laden with sumptuous provisions for his officers the farmers maryland and virginia were reluctant expose the few wagons and teams they had such inevitable destruction neither had they any confidence that the british government would ever remunerate them case their loss four wheeled vehicles were very scarce the colonies there were many people who had never seen one the general after exhausting all his efforts could obtain but twenty four one day was giving vent his indignation franklin suggested that would probably much more easy obtain wagons the more densely settled parts pennsylvania braddock immediately urged him undertake the enterprise unwisely think consented with his son hastened pennsylvania and selected lancaster york and carlisle his centres operation whatever franklin undertook was pretty sure accomplish twenty days obtained one hundred and fifty four horse wagons and two hundred and fifty nine pack horses did not accomplish this feat however until had exhausted all the money which braddock had furnished him had spent over thousand dollars his own money and had given bonds for the safe return horses and wagons whose money value was estimated one hundred thousand dollars braddock was lavish his compliments franklin dined with him daily the idea seemed never have entered braddock mind that british regulars under his command could ever seriously annoyed bands french and indians said one day after taking fort duquesne shall niagara having taken that the season will permit shall proceed fort frontenac fort duquesne can hardly detain more than three four days franklin who was well aware that braddock was entering upon far more formidable campaign than anticipated ventured very modestly suggest sure sir you arrive well before duquesne with the fine troops well provided with artillery the fort though completely fortified and assisted with very strong garrison can probably make but short resistance the only danger apprehend obstruction your march ambuscades the indians who constant practice are dexterous laying and executing them and the slender line near four miles long which your army must make may expose attacked surprise its flanks and cut like thread into several pieces which from their distance cannot come time support each other braddock smiled derisively this ignorance benighted american these savages may indeed said formidable enemy your raw american militia but upon the king regular and disciplined troops impossible that they should make any impression colonel washington regarded the wagons and the long array pack horses many nuisances arresting the rapidity their march and inviting attacks which would impossible repel length the army was motion the progress was very slow franklin was continually forwarding supplies and even advanced between six and seven thousand dollars from his own purse expedite purchases part this never received back the attack upon braddock army and its terrible defeat soon came minute account the conflict given the life george washington one the volumes this series the teamsters cut the traces their horses mounted the swiftest and the frenzy their panic rushed for home the other horses and the wagons with their abounding supplies were left magnify the triumph the exultant indians disastrous was the campaign franklin obtained much credit for the efficient services had rendered war with all its horrors had now penetrated the beautiful region pennsylvania which had enjoyed eighty years peace through the christian philanthropy william penn nearly all the indians beyond the mountains were allies the french the news braddock defeat reached philadelphia about the middle july immediately violent conflict arose between the royalist governor morris and the colonial assembly the legislative body voted liberal taxes for the public defence but very justly was enacted that these taxes should assessed impartially upon all estates alike upon those the wealthy proprietaries well upon the few hundred acres which were owned the humble farmers the proprietaries consisting two the sons william penn revolted against this the governor appointed them their agent course united with them opposition for many weeks the conflict between the assembly and the governor agent the proprietaries raged fiercely under these circumstances military supplies could voted and the peril the community was very great franklin warmly espoused and eloquently advocated the claim the assembly during the months july and august the indians satiated with the vast plunder braddock camp made attempt cross the alleghanies predatory excursions against the more settled portions pennsylvania but september and october ushered scenes horror and carnage too awful depicted villages were laid ashes cottages were burned families tomahawked and scalped women and children carried into captivity and many poor creatures perished the stake the endurance all the tortures which savage ingenuity could devise and still the quakers adhering their principle non resistance refused contribute any money any way unite any military organization for self defence but candor must admitted that had the principles the quakers been adopted the british court this whole disastrous war might have been avoided was war invasion commenced the english they were determined force arms drive the french out the magnificent valleys beyond the mountains the conflict which ensued both parties enlisted all the savages they could allies will not england the judgment held responsible for this war and its woes rouse the quakers sense shame the bodies whole murdered family mutilated and gory were brought philadelphia and paraded through all its streets open wagon november the indians often led french officers were sweeping the frontier all directions killing burning destroying the antagonistic parties the assembly for time laid aside their quarrels and with the exception the quakers adopted vigorous military measures the quakers were generally the most opulent people the state not strange that the common people should reluctant volunteer defend the property the quakers since they refused either shoulder musket contribute dollar the pen franklin rendered wonderful service this crisis with his accustomed toleration could make allowance for the frailties conscience bound men wrote very witty pamphlet which was very widely read and produced powerful impression its character may inferred from the following brief quotation for part says coward but hang fight save the quakers that say replied you will not pump the sinking ship because will save the rats well yourselves the dialogue ends with the following admirable words friends the glory serving and saving others superior the advantage being served and secured let resolutely and generously unite our country cause which die the sweetest all deaths and may the god armies bless our honest endeavors the colonists pennsylvania now generally rushed arms there were the frontiers several flourishing moravian villages they were occupied peculiarly industrious and religious people the traveller through their quiet streets heard morning and evening the voice prayer ascending from many firesides and the melody christian hymns guadenhutton perhaps the most flourishing them was attacked the indians burned and the inhabitants all massacred carried into captivity terrible was the panic the other villages they were liable any day experience the same fate under these circumstances the governor raised five hundred and forty volunteers and placed them under the command franklin with the title general was lead them rapidly possible northampton county for the protection these people his son william was his aid camp proved efficient and valiant soldier was the middle december when this heroic little band commenced its march snow whitened the hills wintry gales swept the bleak plains and moaned through the forests the roads were almost impassable fierce storms often entirely arrested their march the wilderness was very thinly inhabited required the toil month for franklin force his way through these many obstructions the base his operations though was distant not more than ninety miles the troops moved very cautiously guard against ambush the philosopher franklin though had never received military education and was quite inexperienced military affairs was the last man drawn into such net that which the army braddock was destroyed franklin philosopher could appreciate the powerful influence religious motives upon the mind rev beatty was his chaplain whose worth character franklin appreciated before commencing their march all the troops were assembled for religious service after earnest exhortation fidelity and duty fervent prayer was offered the march was conducted with great regularity first scouts advanced semi circular line ranging the woods then came the advanced guard few hundred paces behind the centre followed with all the wagons and baggage then came the rear guard with scouts each flank and spies every hill upon reaching guadenhutton awful scene desolation and carnage met the eye the once happy village presented now but revolting expanse blackened ruins the mangled bodies the dead strewed the ground mutilated alike the savages and the howling wolves franklin ordered huts immediately reared protect his troops from the inclemency the weather man knew better than how make them comfortable and cheerful with the least expense fort was promptly constructed which called fort allen and which could easily repel any attack the indians might make unless they approached with formidable french artillery there were many indications that the indians large numbers were hovering around watching all their movements but the sagacity franklin baffled them they kept concealed without any attack the savages were very cautious men they would seldom engage battle unless they were sure victory trifling incident occurred this time worthy record illustrative the shrewdness general franklin the chaplain complained that the men were remiss attending prayers franklin suggested that though might not exactly consistent with the dignity the chaplain become himself the steward the rum still would order distributed immediately after prayers would probably have all the men gathering around him liked the thought franklin wrote under took the task and with the help few hands measure out the liquor executed satisfaction never were prayers more generally and more punctually attended that think this method preferable the punishment inflicted some military laws for non attendance divine worship bitter quarrels were renewed the assembly the presence franklin was indispensable allay the strife governor morris wrote entreating him immediately return philadelphia happened this time that col clapham new england soldier experience and high repute visited the camp guadenhutton franklin placed him command and warmly commending him the confidence the troops hurried home reached philadelphia the february after two months service the field universal applause greeted him several military companies philadelphia united regiment about twelve hundred men franklin was promptly elected their colonel which office accepted tracing the disasters war interesting observe how many those disasters are owing unpardonable folly some months after franklin departure cold bleak day november large part the garrison unmindful danger were skating like school boys the lehigh river the vigilant indians saw their opportunity like howling wolves they made rush upon the fort entered its open gates and killed captured all its inmates the skaters fled into the woods they were pursued some were killed captured some perished miserably cold and starvation probably few escaped the triumphant savages having plundered the fort and the dwellings all their contents applied the torch and again guadenhutton was reduced pile ashes the controversy which arose between the governor and the assembly became acrimonious the extreme the principles there contended for involved the very existence anything like american liberty for fifteen years the pen and voice franklin were influential this controversy probably did more than any other man prepare the colonists resist the despotism the british court and proclaim their independence the january king charles the second had conferred upon william penn twenty six million acres the best land the universe this land was the new world and received the name pennsylvania return for this grant penn agreed pay annually windsor castle two beaver skins and one fifth the gold and silver which the province might yield also promised govern the province conformity with the laws england could treat with the savages appoint ordinary magistrates and pardon petty crimes but could lay tax and impose law without consent the freemen the province represented the assembly this whole wide realm penn was the absolute proprietor refused sell single acre absolutely but all the sales reserved for himself what may called ground rent immense tracts were sold forty shillings about ten dollars for one hundred acres reserving rent one shilling for each hundred acres also reserved entirely himself various portions the territory which promised become the site important cities and villages all these rights descended the heirs william penn seventy four years passed away when the estate thus founded was estimated worth ten millions sterling and popular belief affirmed that produced revenue one hundred thousand pounds penn when died bequeathed the province his three sons john thomas and richard john gave double part one half pennsylvania john died and left his half thomas who thus became proprietor three fourths the province while richard held one fourth thus there were but two proprietors thomas and richard penn they were both weak men resided england were thoroughly imbued with tory principles and the consciousness their vast estates assumed lords and princes they ruled their province deputy governor his position was indeed sinecure the two proprietaries who appointed him could any time deprive him office the assembly could refuse vote his salary and displeased the king england might lose not only his office but his head the controversy which had arisen consequence these involvements between the proprietaries and the people engrossed universal attention during the four years between and the ravaged colony pennsylvania had raised the sum two hundred and eighteen thousand pounds sterling over million dollars for defending its borders and still the two lordly proprietaries demanded that their vast possessions should entirely exempt from taxation earnest remonstrance the assembly they returned insulting answer which they said are more bound pay taxes than any other chief governor the king colonies your agitation this matter new trick secure your election advise you show the respect due the rank which the crown has been pleased bestow upon the people pennsylvania ordinary times are lightly taxed that they hardly know that they are taxed what fools you are agitating this dangerous topic american taxation beneath the dignity the assembly make trouble about such small sums money not deny that you have been some expense pacifying the indians but that affair ours already give the province larger sum per annum than our share the taxes would amount one for example sent over four hundred pounds worth cannon for the defence our city philadelphia such was their answer was conveyed sixteen sentences which were numbered and which were very similar the ones have given the communication excited great displeasure was considered alike false and insolent even the tranquil mind franklin was fired with indignation replied the document with power eloquence and logic which carried the convictions nearly all the colonists chapter franklin mission england new marks respect lord loudoun gov denny and franklin visit the indians franklin

savage horrors retaliating cruelties franklin efforts behalf the moravian indians the general impression produced throughout the colonies the controversy with the proprietaries was that they were very weak men indeed does not appear that they were much regarded even london gentleman writing from that city said they are hardly found the herd gentry not court not office not parliament march franklin left his home for post office tour some forty the officers his regiment well mounted and rich uniform without franklin knowledge came his door escort him out the village franklin says had not previously been made acquainted with their project should have prevented being naturally averse the assuming state any occasion the proprietaries london heard account this affair they were very much displeased saying they had never been thus honored and that princes the blood alone were entitled such distinction the war was still raging large bodies troops were crossing the ocean united with the colonial forces lord loudoun was appointed the court commander chief for america was exceedingly weak and inefficient man scarcely soldier the ranks could found more incompetent for the situation governor morris pennsylvania worn out with his unavailing conflicts with the assembly was withdrawn and the proprietaries sent out captain william denny their obsequious servant his stead the philadelphians hoping conciliate him received him cordially and with public entertainment william franklin wrote change devils according the scotch proverb blithesome the close the feast when most the party were making themselves merry over their wine governor denny took franklin aside into adjoining room and endeavored the most abounding flattery and the bribe rich promises induce him espouse the cause the proprietaries but soon learned that franklin could not influenced any his bribes there was but brief lull the storm governor denny had power his own could only obey the peremptory instructions had received these instructions were irreconcilably hostile the resolves the assembly franklin was the all powerful leader the popular party there was something his imperturbable good nature which difficult explain scenes woe seemed depress his cheerful spirits atrocities oppression could excite his indignation could thrust his keen dagger points into the vitals his antagonist with smile upon his face and jokes upon his lips which would convulse both friend and foe with laughter was the most unrelenting antagonist governor denny the assembly and yet was the only man who remained good terms with the governor visiting him and dining with him governor denny was gentleman and well educated and few men could appear better advantage the saloons fashion but was trammeled beyond all independent action the instructions had received from the proprietaries was right heart was sympathy with franklin and with reluctance endeavored enforce the arbitrary measures with which was entrusted franklin was one the most companionable men his wonderful powers conversation his sweetness temper and his entire ignoring all aristocratic assumption made him one the most fascinating guests every circle charmed alike the rich and the poor the learned and the ignorant november accompanied governor denny the frontier confer with the chiefs several indian tribes the savages say the least were punctilious the observance the laws honor securing the safety the ambassadors such occasion were the english the governor and the philosopher rode side side horseback accompanied only few body servants the governor familiar with the clubs and the wits england entertained franklin the highest degree with the literary gossip london and probably excited his mind intense desire visit those scenes which himself was calculated enjoy and embellish the journey wrote the following comic letter his wife had been disappointed not receiving line from her certain messenger had good mind not write you this opportunity but never can ill natured enough even when there most occasion think won tell you that are well and that expect return about the middle the week nor will send you word news

purposes with the assembly resolved make final appeal the king the house promptly decided imitate his example its speaker norris and benjamin franklin were appointed commissioners the speaker declined the office and franklin was left sole commissioner probably was not all reluctant introduced the statesmen the philosophers and the fashionable circles the old world defray his expenses the assembly voted sum nearly eight thousand dollars had also wealth his own correspondence was quite intimately acquainted with very many the scientific men england and france was very certain that would have the any circle which might wish honor with his presence was that time very serious affair cross the atlantic the ocean swarmed with pirates privateers and men war the fourth april franklin with his son william set out from philadelphia his cheerfulness spirits did not forsake him left home where had been remarkably happy for twenty six years the family left behind him consisted his wife his wife aged mother his daughter sarah beautiful child twelve years one two nieces and old nurse the family franklin had written the governor ascertain the precise time when the packet would sail the reply received from him was have given out that the ship sail saturday next but may let you know entre nous that you are there monday morning you will time but not delay any longer franklin was accompanied number his friends far trenton where they spent very joyful evening together one the ferries this road they were delayed obstructions that they could not reach the hudson river until noon monday franklin feared that the ship might sail without him but upon reaching the river was relieved seeing the vessel still the stream eleven weeks passed before lord loudoun would issue his permission for the ship sail every day this most dilatory and incompetent men announced that the packet would sail morrow and thus the weeks rolled while franklin was waiting but not hear single word impatience remonstrance from his lips his philosophy taught him happy under all circumstances with smiling face called upon lord loudoun and dined with him endeavored but vain obtain settlement his claims for supplies furnished braddock army found much the society new york entertain him and more than all and above all was doing everything that could done for the accomplishment his mission why then should worry new york records was growing immensely rich money brought into from all quarters for the pay and subsistence the troops franklin was remarkably gallant his intercourse with ladies kept quite brisk correspondence with several the most brilliant ladies the day man could more prettily pay compliment his lively and beautiful friend miss ray wrote upon his departure present best compliments all that love should have said all that love you but that would giving you too much trouble length lord loudoun granted permission for the packet drop down the lower bay where large fleet ninety vessels was assembled fitted out for attack upon the french louisburg franklin and his friends went board was announced that the vessel would certainly sail morrow for six weeks longer the packet rode there anchor franklin and his companions had for the third time consumed all the provisions they had laid store for the voyage still hear not murmur from our imperturbable philosopher length the signal for sailing was given the whole squadron put sea and the london packet with all the rest was swept forward toward louisburg after voyage five days letter was placed the hands the captain authorizing him quit the fleet and steer for england the days and nights long voyage came and went when the packet midnight gale wind and enveloped fogs was approaching falmouth light house upon some rocks had not been visible suddenly the lifting the fog revealed the light house and the craggy shore over which the surf was fearfully breaking the distance but few rods captain the royal navy who chanced near the helmsman sprang the helm called upon the sailors instantly wear ship and thus the risk snapping every mast saved the vessel and the crew from otherwise immediate and certain destruction there was not that time single light house the north american coast the event impressed the mind franklin deeply and resolved that upon his return light houses should constructed about nine clock the next morning the fog was slowly dispersed and falmouth with its extended tower its battlemented castles and the forests masts was opened before the weary voyagers was sunday morning and the bells were ringing for church the vessel glided into the harbor and joyfully the passengers landed franklin writes the bell ringing for church went thither immediately and with hearts full gratitude returned sincere thanks god far the mercies had received know not whether this devout act was suggested franklin whether courteously fell with the arrangement proposed perhaps some religious companion however certain that the sentence which next followed his letter came gushing from his own mind were roman catholic perhaps should this occasion vow build chapel some saint but not were vow all should build light house required journey two hundred and fifty miles reach london franklin and his son posted london which was the most rapid mode traveling those days they seem have enjoyed the journey the highest degree through blooming beautiful highly cultivated england almost every thing the charming landscape appeared different from the rude settlements which were springing amid the primeval forests the new world they visited the cathedral salisbury stonehenge wilton hall the palatial mansion the earl pembroke england was her loveliest attire perhaps there could not then found

where had worked forty years before and treated the workmen with that beer which had formerly efficiently denounced that same place soon took lodgings with very agreeable landlady mrs stevenson craven street strand adopted not ostentatious but very genteel style living both and his son had brought with them each body servant from america set modest carriage that might worthily present himself the doors cabinet ministers and members parliament the proprietaries received him very coldly almost insolently they were haughty reserved and totally uninfluenced his arguments presented them brief memorandum which very lucidly explained the views the assembly was follows the royal charter gives the assembly the power make laws the proprietary instructions deprive that power the royal charter confers the assembly the right grant withhold supplies the instructions neutralize that right the exemption the proprietary estate from taxation unjust the proprietaries are besought consider these grievances seriously and redress them that harmony may restored the penn brothers denounced this brief document vague and disrespectful was evident that franklin had nothing hope from them therefore directed all his energies win his side the lords trade and the members the king council whom the final decision must referred twelve months elapsed during which nothing was accomplished but hear not

flattery the whole writes franklin must say that the time spent there scotland was six weeks the densest happiness have met with any part life still evident that occasionally felt some slight yearnings for the joys that home over which his highly esteemed wife presided with such economy and skill wrote her the regard and friendship meet with from persons worth and the conversation ingenuous men give small pleasure but this time life domestic comforts afford the most solid satisfaction and uneasiness being absent from family and longing desire with them make often sigh the midst

respect perfectly agreeable some are amiable one view some another all three years thus passed away must not supposed that the patriotic and faithful franklin lost any opportunity whatever urge the all important cause with which was entrusted his philosophy taught him that when absolutely could not any thing but wait was best wait the most agreeable and profitable manner was one his strong desires which was compelled abandon convert the proprietary province pennsylvania into royal province after franklin left philadelphia the strife between the assembly and governor denny the representative the proprietaries became more violent than ever the governor worn out the ceaseless struggle yielded some points this offended the proprietaries indignantly they dismissed him and appointed his place james hamilton more obsequious servant the royal charter was provided that all laws passed the assembly and signed the governor should sent the king for his approval one the bills which the governor compelled were the peril public affairs had signed allowed the assembly raise sum about five hundred thousand dollars raised tax all estates this was dangerous precedent the aristocratic court england repealed encroachment upon the rights the privileged classes was severe blow the assembly the speaker wrote franklin are among rocks and sands stormy season depends upon you

remembered was not born wedlock very lovely english lady miss stephenson but this young man who renouncing revealed religion was law unto himself had already become father without being husband miss

political parties were thus organized the governor intensely inimical franklin led all the loose fellows who approved the massacre the friendly indians franklin was supported the humane portion the community who regarded that massacre with horror there was much bitterness engendered franklin was assailed and calumniated one the worst men usual wrote pamphlet which was read far and wide earnestly urged that the crown had right should purchase take possession the province and convert its government into that royal colony should remembered that this was several years before the troubles the

districts each colony the voice intelligent and dignified rebuke the act was into execution the first november before that time franklin had spread through all the mechanical mercantile and commercial classes the conviction that they would suffer ten fold more the interruptions trade which the stamp act would introduce than government could hope gain the measure spread abroad the intelligence which came every fresh arrival that the americans were resolving with wonderful unanimity that they would consume more english manufactures that they would purchase more british goods and that far possible food clothing and household furniture they would depend upon their own productions they had even passed resolves eat more lamb that their flocks might increase that they should have wool enough manufacture their own clothing england had thus far furnished nearly all the supplies for the rapidly increasing colonies already numbering population between two and three millions the sudden

overshadowed all the rest the record was read with admiration seldom has man been placed more embarrassing situation and never has one under such circumstances acquitted himself more triumphantly was examined and cross examined before this vast and imposing assemblage the shrewdest lawyers the crown every attempt was made throw him into embarrassment trip him his speech but never for moment did franklin lose his self possession never for instant did hesitate his reply the judgment all his friends not mistake did make his mind seemed omnisciently furnished with all the needful statistics for rigorous examination any mortal was ever exposed burke wrote friend that franklin stood before the bar parliament presented such aspect dignity and intellectual superiority remind him schoolmaster

courage rarely surpassed boldly exclaimed the house lords were american englishman would never lay down arms never never never all england there was man more determined his resolve bring the americans servile obedience than the stubborn king george iii the repeal gave him intense offence the equally unprincipled but more intelligent ministers were compelled the measure they saw clearly that england

the destruction trade was the prospect future still the question the repeal was carried the house but majority one hundred and eight votes course franklin now solicited permission return home the assembly instead granting his request elected him agent for another year does not appear that franklin was disappointed the report his splendid and triumphant examination before the commons and the republication many his pamphlets had raised him the highest position popularity the americans throughout all the provinces received tidings the repeal with unbounded delight bells were rung bon fires

difficulty was myself the channel through which the money passed with own hand secured above one hundred and twenty votes that most important question ministers eighty thousand pounds were set apart for the purpose forty members the house commons received from thousand pounds each eighty others paid five hundred pounds piece the unrelenting king was still determined that the americans unrepresented parliament should still pay into his treasury whatever sums money might exact calling his aid courtiers more shrewd than himself they devised very cunning act attain that object way which would hardly likely excite opposition they laid tax insignificant really its amount upon paper paint glass and tea this tax was collected the custom houses the few ports entry the colonies the whole amount thus raised would not exceed forty thousand pounds was thought that the americans would never make opposition trivial payment but established principle that england could tax the colonies without allowing those colonies any representation parliament the court had right thus demand forty thousand pounds they had right demand many millions should seem expedient king and cabinet the great blunder which the court committed was not appreciating the wide spread intelligence the american people new england particularly and throughout the colonies generally there was scarcely farmer who did not perceive the trick and despise they deemed insult their intelligence instantly there arose throughout all the provinces the most determined opposition the measure was fact merely renewal the stamp act under slightly modified forms they admitted the justice this act was only declaring that they had acted with unpardonable folly opposing the tax under the previous form franklin with honest shrewdness not with trickery with cunning but with sincere and penetrating mind eagerly scrutinized all the measures the court george iii was gentleman was irreproachable all his domestic relations

massachusetts assembly met secret session the letters were read soon some copies were printed was said that some one had obtained from england copies the letters from which the printed impressions were taken but the mystery their publication was never solved the assembly sent petition the king england imploring that thomas hutchinson and andrew oliver should removed from their posts and that such good men the king might select should placed their stead the petition eminently respectful but drawn very forcible language expressive the ruinous consequences caused the measures which these officials had recommended was transmitted franklin the latter part the summer immediately forwarded lord dartmouth with sent very polite and conciliatory letter which declared that the americans were very desirous being good terms with the mother country that their resentment against the government was greatly abated finding that americans had urged the obnoxious measures which had been adopted and that the present was very favorable time introduce cordial friendly relations between the king and the colonists lord dartmouth returned very polite reply laid the all important petition aside and for five months never alluded word letter the meantime some the printed copies reached london the tories thought that perhaps the long sought opportunity had come when they might pounce upon franklin and least greatly impair his influence franklin had nothing conceal had received the letters from friend who authorized him send them america that their contents might made known there all this had done absolutely nothing which any one could pronounce wrong but the court being determined stir strife began demand who was that had obtained and delivered the letters franklin was absent from london

graciously and would submit the consideration parliament was thought not respectful the king publish before had presented that body but usual the infatuation both king and court was such that everything that came from the americans was treated with neglect not with contempt the all important petition was buried pile documents upon all conceivable subjects and not one word was said commend the consideration either house for three days remained unnoticed franklin then with his two companions solicited permission heard the bar the house their request was refused this brought the question into debate the house commons was that time but reflected image the house lords was composed almost exclusively the younger sons the nobles and such other obsequious servants the aristocracy they with their vast wealth and patronage saw fit have elected there was immense tory majority the house they assailed the petition with vulgarity abuse which could scarcely exceeded and then dismissed from further consideration noble lords made themselves merry depicting the alacrity with which whole army americans would disperse the very sound british cannon while these disastrous events were taking place england events sure usher cruel and bloody war bearing its wings terror and conflagration tears and blood domestic tragedy was taking place the far distant home franklin the banks the delaware

seriously mar her happiness every spring she was confident that would return the next autumn and then bore her disappointment bravely the assurance that she should see him the coming spring december she was suddenly stricken down paralytic stroke five days unconscious slumber passed away when she fell into that deep and dreamless sleep which has earthly waking her funeral was attended large concourse citizens with every testimonial respect some franklin oldest friends bore the coffin the churchyard where the remains the affectionate wife and mother who had nobly fulfilled life duties were placed the side her father her mother and her infant son feelingly does parton write mournful think that for many years she should have been deprived her husband society the very qualities which made her good wife rendered possible for him remain absent from his affairs franklin all unconscious the calamity which had darkened his home and weary the conflict with the british court was eagerly making preparations return philadelphia the aged illustrious eloquent earl chatham one the noblest england all grasping and ambitious sons sought interview with franklin utterly condemned the policy the british cabinet his sympathies were not only from principles policy but from convictions justice cordially with the americans felt sure that unless the court should retrace its steps war would ensue and american independence would follow and that england with the loss her colonies would find mercantile impoverishment and political weakness the course conversation implied that america might

company eating drinking and conversing with them freely had never heard any conversation from any person drunk sober the least expression wish for separation hint that such thing would advantageous america subsequent interview the earl chatham alluding the conduct congress drawing the petition and address said they have acted with much temper moderation and wisdom that think the most honorable assembly statesmen since those the greeks and romans the most virtuous times subsequent interview franklin expressed the earl his apprehension that the continuance the british army boston which was the source constant irritation the people might eventually lead quarrel perhaps between drunken porter and soldier and that thus tumult and bloodshed might introduced leading consequences which one could foresee lord chatham felt the force these remarks which soon received their striking illustration what was called the boston massacre therefore declared his intention repairing the house lords introduce resolve for the immediate withdrawal the troops from boston the tidings were soon noised abroad that the eloquent earl then probably the most illustrious man england was make speech favor america the eventful day arrived the hall was crowded franklin had special invitation from the earl present the friends america were there few numbers and the enemies all their strength lord chatham made speech which logical power and glowing eloquence has perhaps never been surpassed franklin had impressed him with the conviction that the determination the americans defend their rights was such that with fleet and army the government were ravage all the coast and burn all the cities the americans would retreat back into the forests the maintenance their liberty full this idea lord chatham exclaimed with prophetic power shall forced ultimately retract let retract while can not when must say must necessarily undo these violent oppressive acts you will repeal them pledge myself for stake reputation will consent taken for idiot they are not finally repealed franklin writes all availed more than the whistling the wind the motion was rejected sixteen scotch peers and twenty four bishops with all the lords possession expectation places when they vote together unanimously for ministerial measures they generally make dead majority that renders all debate ridiculous itself since can answer end though the speech produced impression upon the obdurate house lords had very powerful effect upon the public mind was read america collegiate halls the work shop and the farmer fireside with delight which cannot described few days after the speech franklin writing lord stanhope said franklin filled with admiration that truly great man has seen the course life sometimes eloquence without wisdom and often wisdom without eloquence the present instance sees both united and both thinks the highest degree possible slowly the ministry were awaking the conviction that american affairs not settled might yet cause them much trouble various underhand ways they approached franklin was generally understood that every man had his price that the influence one man could bought for few hundred pounds that another would require lucrative and honorable office though the reputation franklin was such that was delicate matter approach him with bribes still some them now commenced course flattery endeavoring secure his was thought that his influence with his countrymen was great that they would accede any terms should recommend lord howe called upon franklin and the name lord north and lord dartmouth the two most influential members the ministry informed him that they sincerely sought reconciliation and that they were prepared listen favorably any reasonable propositions might offer lord howe was the friend franklin and america these unexpected and joyful tidings affected franklin deeply that could not conceal the tears which rolled down his cheeks lord howe then added that was instructed say that the service would thus render both england and america would priceless value and that though the ministers could not think influencing him any selfish motives might expect return any reward which was the power government bestow this said franklin was what the french vulgarly called spitting the soup but again there was meeting parliament again became evident that the ministry would accede terms which did not secure the entire subjugation america lord chatham made renewed attempt conciliate his propositions were rejected with scorn the meantime franklin had presented some hints drawn the most liberal spirit compromise but which still maintained the american principle that the colonists could not taxed the pleasure the court without having any voice themselves the amount which they were pay soon after this barclay called upon franklin the name the government and after long and franklin disgusting diplomatic harangue ventured say him that would only comply with the wishes the ministry might expect almost any reward could wish for even the imperturbable spirit franklin was roused replied the ministry sure would rather give place cart tyburn than any other place whatever sincerely wish serviceable and need other inducement that might another interview which soon followed appeared that the government refused concede single point which the americans deemed essential they refused withdraw the troops refused allow the colonial governors appoint the collectors the customs persisted building fortresses hold the people subjection and adhered the claim parliament legislate for the colonies franklin said while parliament claims the power altering our constitution pleasure there can agreement are rendered unsafe every privilege and are secure nothing barclay insolently replied would well for the americans come agreement with the court great britain they ought not forget how easy thing will for the british men war lay all their seaport towns ashes grew warm writes franklin said that the chief part little property consisted houses those towns that they might make bon fires them whenever they pleased that the fear losing them would never alter resolution resist the last such claims parliament and that behoved this country take care what mischief did for that sooner later would certainly obliged make good all damages with interest still again these corrupt men who are selling themselves and buying others approached franklin with attempts bribe him they could not comprehend that any man could above the reach such influences was contemplated sending lord howe america commissioner applied franklin with him friend assistant secretary lord howe said franklin that could not think undertaking the mission without him that effected any thing valuable must owing the advice franklin would afford him and that should make scruple giving him the full honor assured him that the ministry did not expect his assistance without proper consideration that they wished make generous and ample appointments for those who aided them and also would give them the promise subsequent more ample rewards and said with marked emphasis that the ministry may have opportunity showing their good disposition toward yourself will you give leave franklin procure for you previously some mark suppose the payment here the arrears your salary agent for new england which understand they have stopped for some time past will remembered that lord howe was sincerely the friend america and that anxiously desired see friendly relations restored franklin therefore restrained his displeasure and courteously replied lord shall deem great honor any shape joined with your lordship good work but you hope service from any influence may supposed have drop all thoughts procuring any previous favors from ministers accepting them would destroy the very influence you propose make use they would considered many bribes betray the interests country only let see the propositions and shall not hesitate for moment repeated interviews ensued between franklin and both the friends and the enemies the americans there were interminable conferences but the court was implacable its resolve maintain supreme and exclusive control over the colonies every hour franklin time was engrossed merchants and manufacturers tories and the opposition lords temporal and lords spiritual all called upon him with their several plans there were many americans london including large number quakers these crowded the apartment franklin the negotiations were terminated debate the house lords which the americans were assailed the vilest language insult and abuse which can coined franklin was present writes were treated with the utmost contempt the lowest mankind and almost different species from the english britain particularly american honesty was abused some the lords who asserted that were all knaves and wanted only this dispute avoid paying our debts franklin returned his home with feelings indignation which his calm spirit had rarely before experienced resolved longer have any thing with the hostile governing powers england had loved the british empire felt proud its renown and that america was but part and parcel its greatness but there was longer hope that there could any escape from the awful appeal arms though that measure would fraught with inconceivable woes for his countrymen was assured that they would never submit they would now march independence though the path led through scenes conflagration blood and unutterable woe his experience placed him advance all his countrymen franklin immediately commenced packing his trunks astonishing almost incredible may appear the evidence seems conclusive that through all these trying scenes franklin was cheerful hardly too strong word use jovial man has been well said that angry punish one self for the sins another our philosopher had idea making himself unhappy because british lords behaved like knaves continued one the most entertaining companions cloudless sun seemed shine wherever moved made witty speeches wrote the most amusing articles for the journals and the invariable gayety his mind caused his society eagerly sought for one evening attended quite brilliant party nobleman house who was friend america the conversation chanced turn upon esop fables was said that that mine illustration was exhausted franklin after moment thought remarked that many new fables could invented instructive any those esop gay fontaine can you think one now asked lord think said franklin you will furnish with pencil and paper immediately sat down surrounded the gay assembly and wrote rapidly his pencil could move the eagle and the cat once upon time eagle scaling round farmer barn and espying hare darted down upon him like sunbeam seized him his claws and remounted with him into the air soon found that had creature more courage and strength than the hare for which had mistaken cat the snarling and scrambling his prey were very inconvenient and what was worse she had disengaged herself from his talons grasped his body with her four limbs stop his breath and seized fast hold his throat with her teeth pray said the eagle let your hold and will release you very fine said the cat but have fancy fall from this height and crushed death you have taken and you shall stoop and let down the eagle thought necessary stoop accordingly this admirable fable was read the company and all were sympathy with america was received with great applause little however did any them then imagine how invincible was the animal the british government was about clutch its talons supposing defenseless hare franklin spent his last day london with priestly the doctor bears glowing testimony his admirable character many thought franklin heartless since view all the horrors civil war his hilarity was never interrupted priestly alluding this charge against franklin says that they spent the day looking over the american papers and extracting from them passages published england reading them writes franklin was frequently not able proceed for the tears literally running down his cheeks upon his departure surrendered his agency arthur lee was the march when franklin embarked portsmouth pennsylvania packet franklin was apprehensive until the last moment that would not permitted depart that the court which had repeatedly denounced him traitor would arrest him some frivolous charge the voyage wrote minute narrative his diplomatic career occupying two hundred and fifty pages foolscap this important document was given his son william franklin who was daily becoming more inveterate tory endeavoring ingratiate himself into favor with the court from which had received the appointment governor franklin also sent copy jefferson perhaps apprehensive that his son might not deal fairly with document which terribly condemned the british government the governor subsequently published the narrative but there reason suppose that suppressed those passages which revealed most clearly the atrocious conduct the british cabinet jefferson wrote some years later alluding this document remember that lord north answers were dry unyielding the spirit unconditional submission and betrayed absolute indifference the occurrence rupture and said the mediators distinctly last that rebellion was not deprecated the part great britain that the confiscations would produce would provide for many their friends the idea that the feeble americans scattered along coast more than thousand miles extent without fortress vessel war regiment regular troops could withstand the fleets and armies great britain was never entertained for moment indeed now contemplate the fearful odds causes one heart throb and cannot but amazed the courage which our patriotic fathers displayed was common boast england that one regiment british regulars could march from boston charleston and sweep all opposition before them band ten wolves can put flock ten thousand sheep flight was quite pleasant thought the haughty court that one two ships war and two three regiments could sent across the atlantic seize and hang washington franklin adams jefferson and others our leading patriots and confiscate the property hundreds others for the enrichment the favorites

dared not betray their trust washington adams jay would have made almost any conceivable sacrifice their personal interest they could have averted the calamity separation from the home their ancestors but the conduct the british cabinet was not only despotic the highest degree but was insolent and contemptuous beyond all endurance seemed generally assumed that man born the majestic continent north america instead being born their little island must inferior being they regarded americans slave holders were accustomed regard the negro almost every interview resolved itself into insult courteous intercourse was impossible affection gave place detestation the september congress assembled philadelphia lexington bunker hill and other hostile acts our implacable foes had thrown the whole country into the most intense agitation military companies were every where being organized musket manufactories and powder mills were reared ladies were busy scraping lint and preparing bandages and what was the cause all this commotion which converted america for seven years into aceldama blood and woe was that haughty insolent men england claimed the right impose taxes whatever amount they pleased upon

adoption very important measures while the camp news came the burning portland then falmouth was deed which would have disgraced american savages the town was entirely defenceless held out menace whatever the foe the cold blasts maine winter were hand british man war entered the harbor and giving but few hours notice that the sick and the dying might removed and that the women and children

became intimate and loving friends speaks well for both that the free thinking philosopher and the catholic priest could recognize each other virtues forget their speculative differences mutual regard there was before the commissioners very laborious journey five hundred miles much leading through almost unexplored wilderness shows great zeal franklin that the age seventy was willing encounter such exposure late march the commissioners left philadelphia two days they reached new york they found the place deserted its inhabitants was held but few soldiers was hourly expected that the british from their fleet and batteries would open upon terrific bombardment how little can imagine the sufferings which must ensue when thousands families are driven terror from their homes from all their means

that have undertaken fatigue which time life may prove too much for after short tarry the country seat general sullivan saratoga the party moved toward lake george those northern latitudes the ground was still covered with snow and the lake was filled with floating ice two days very exhausting travel brought them the southern shore the beautiful but then dreary lake here they took large boat thirty six feet long and eight broad was what was called bateau which was flat bottomed and was but one foot depth there was one mast and blanket sail which was available when the wind was directly aft there was cabin mere awning sheltered partially from wind and rain thus they crept across the lake through masses ice distance thirty six miles thirty six hours there was neck land four miles breadth which separated lake george from lake champlain the heavy boat placed wheels was dragged across six yoke oxen delay five days was thus caused before they were ready embark the latter lake the navigation this small sheet water surrounded the primeval forest and with scarcely the cabin white man seen must have been romantic indeed they sailed when the wind favored and rowed when was adverse night they ran ashore built their camp fire which illumined lake and forest boiled their coffee cooked their viands and some under the awning and some under the shelter hastily constructed camp slept sweetly the ice greatly impeded their progress three and half days they reached john near the upper end the lake the toilsome journey another day brought them montreal none the commissioners were accustomed thus roughing all were greatly exhausted council war was convened canada was clearly lost the americans was once decided that nothing remained but withdraw the troops early june franklin

this assailment turning him said one the most characteristic and popular all his utterances when was journeyman printer one companions apprenticed hatter was about open shop for himself his first concern was have handsome sign board with proper inscription composed these words john thompson hatter makes and sells hats for ready money but thought would submit his friends for their amendments the first showed thought the word hatter tautologous because followed the words makes hats which showed that was hatter was struck out the next observed that the word makes might well omitted because his customers would not care who made the hats good and their mind they would buy whomsoever made struck out third said thought the words for ready money were useless was not the custom the place sell credit every one who purchased expected pay they were parted with the inscription now stood john thompson sells hats sells hats says his next friend why nobody will expect you give them away what then the use that word was stricken out and hats followed the rather there was one painted the board his inscription was reduced ultimately john thompson with the figure hat subjoined will remembered the readiness with which franklin the spur the moment threw off the admirable fable the eagle and the hare altogether probable that the inexhaustible resources his genius improvised this anecdote meet the exigencies the occasion when the hessian troops whom england had hired german prince arrived intelligent men this country pitied rather than blamed those simple hearted peasants who had animosity whatever against the americans they had been compelled their feudal lord who was really their slave master leave their lowly homes the rhine unite with english regulars and painted savages burning the homes and butchering the people struggling for existence the wilderness the new world again the all availing pen franklin was called into requisition direction congress drew friendly address these unfortunate men offering every german who would abandon the ignominious service which his prince had sold him tract rich land sufficient for ample farm the address was translated into german various were the devices adopted give the document circulation the hessian camp doubtless exerted powerful influence disarming these highly disciplined troops all animosity the effect was perhaps seen the spectacle witnessed few weeks afterwards when nine hundred these soldiers were led through the streets philadelphia prisoners war not improbable that many them were more than willing throw down their arms the july franklin was chosen the convention one nine delegates represent pennsylvania the national congress one the great difficulties surmounted union the states was give the great states like new york and pennsylvania their own preponderance the confederacy while the minor states like new jersey and delaware should not shorn their influence the difficulty was finally obviated the present admirable arrangement which each state great small has two representatives the senate while their representation the house depends upon the number the population franklin excelled the art putting things silenced the demand the smaller states all respects equality with the larger saying let the smaller colonies give equal money and men and then have equal vote but they have equal vote without bearing equal burdens confederation upon such iniquitous principles will never last long the convention form constitution for the state pennsylvania met philadelphia the july franklin was unanimously chosen president pen can describe the intensity his labors all appreciated his consummate wisdom and yielded readily his suggestions troops were hurrying and fro one hundred and twenty british war vessels were new york harbor one knew upon what seaport the thunderbolts this formidable armament would hurled the americans had been defeated long island august and had almost miraculously escaped with their field pieces and stores across the east river new york this brilliant retreat was deemed the americans almost equivalent victory lord howe the old friend franklin and humane and respected englishman who was sincerely desirous peace with the colonies was appointed admiral the king naval forces accepted the appointment with the hope that the aid franklin reconciliation might effected still was englishman and could not conceive that americans had any rights which the english government was bound respect the degree his infatuation may inferred from the fact that soon reached our shores published declaration which circulated far and wide stating that the americans would only give the conflict and return implicit submission the british government would forgive their sins pardon the guilty ones with few exceptions and receive them again favor the weak man seemed really think that this was extraordinary act clemency the part the english court the reply which franklin drew the declaration was grand and was the more grand when reflect that was addressed man who was supported army know not how many thousand british regulars and fleet one hundred and twenty war vessels many which were gigantic armament admiral howe had written courteous private letter franklin which enclosed the declaration congress gave franklin permission reply wrote lord the official despatches which you refer contain nothing more than offers pardon upon submission directing pardon offered the colonies who are the very parties injured expresses indeed that opinion our ignorance baseness and insensibility which your uninformed and proud nation has long been pleased entertain impossible that should think submission government that has with the most wanton barbarity and cruelty burnt our defenseless towns the midst winter excited the savages massacre our farmers and our slaves murder their masters and even now bringing foreign mercenaries deluge our settlements with blood have not space copy the remainder this admirable letter was delivered lord howe board his flag ship new york harbor ten days after its date read his countenance expressed surprise and almost his only remark was old friend has expressed himself very warmly few weeks later this good natured but weak man paroled general sullivan who was prisoner war and sent him philadelphia with message congress which lord howe cautiously declined put upon paper general sullivan reduced the message writing and presented congress was substance follows the government england cannot admit that congress legitimate body recognized any diplomatic relations whatever but tumultous assembly men who have treasonably conspired against their lawful sovereign still the government willing that lord howe should confer with some the members congress private gentlemen see some terms accommodation cannot arranged after much and earnest discussion which great diversity opinion prevailed was voted that general sullivan should inform admiral howe that committee three would sent ascertain whether has any authority treat with persons authorized congress for that purpose benjamin franklin john adams and edward rutledge composed this committee antique house nearly hundred years old formerly the abode wealth and splendor which stood green lawn but few rods from the beach the western shore staten island was chosen the place for the conference two days journey conveyed the committee amboy opposite the house adams traveled horseback franklin and rutledge two wheel chaise admiral howe sent boat under the protection flag truce with officer who stated that was left behind hostage for their safe return promptly they declined manifesting any such distrust the honor admiral howe and took the hostage back the boat with them the barge propelled lusty rowers soon reached the staten island shore large apartment the old stone house had been richly decorated with moss and branches honor the occasion regiment hessians was posted that spot the colonel drew them two lines and through this lane soldiers the commissioners advanced from the beach the house when admiral howe saw that the officer had sent hostage had been returned said gentlemen you pay high compliment cordially the kind hearted admiral received his guests and invited them ample collation cold ham tongues mutton and wine henry strachey secretary lord howe wrote very full report the interview which accords entirely with the narrative which john adams presented congress sincere and friendly words human lips could pronounce the admiral assured the american gentlemen his earnest desire promote reconciliation between the colonists and the mother country alluded the fact that england had been regarded the friend america and the honor massachusetts had conferred upon his family rearing monument his brother who had fallen ticonderoga franklin well knew that howe was regarded the friend america assure you gentlemen said lord howe that esteem that honor family above all things this world such gratitude and affection this country that account that feel for america for brother and america should fall should feel and lament like the loss brother the reply franklin these sincere words seems little discourteous assuming air great indifference and confidence though the fall america was idea not thought bowed and with one his blandest smiles said assure you lord that will everything our power save your lordship from that mortification the admiral was feeling too deeply for jokes was wounded the rebuke apparently contained the reply his old friend but must not forgotten that franklin the sweetest tempered men had not yet recovered from the indignation caused the barbarities inflicted the british government upon the families falmouth every day was bringing tidings the atrocities which england through its savage allies was perpetrating the frontiers burning the cabins lonely farmers and tomahawking and scalping women and children and was constrained look upon lord howe the agent that government commissioned bear the patriots america only the insulting messages that the king and his ministers would graciously pardon them the crime attempting resist their despotism they would ask forgiveness and future submit uncomplainingly the requirements the crown thus while the kind hearted admiral with bosom glowing with brotherly sympathy was acting upon the assumption that the americans should cherish undying emotions gratitude the king that was ready forgive their disobedience his commands franklin and his companions found difficult restrain their emotions indignation view the truly diabolical course pursued the british government the court their judgment merited the execrations not only americans but all humanity lord howe very emphatically wished the commissioners understand that met them merely private individuals and that could not the slightest degree recognize any authority congress franklin coldly replied your lordship may consider any view you may think proper our part are liberty consider ourselves our real character john adams replied with warmth characteristic his impetuous nature your lordship may consider what light you please indeed should willing consider myself for few moments any character which would agreeable your lordship except that british subject the conversation was continued franklin said have been deputed congress simply inquire your lordship what proposition you have offer for the consideration congress british troops have ravaged our country and burnt our towns cannot again happy under the government great britain all former attachments are obliterated america can never return the domination great britain adams added lord not our power treat otherwise than independent states for part avow determination never depart from the idea independency rutledge gave emphasis these decisive words saying with regard the people consenting come again under the english government impossible can answer for south carolina the royal government there was very oppressive last took the government into our own hands the people are now settled and happy under that government they would not now return the king government even congress should desire here the conference ended lord howe stating that they insisted upon independence accommodation was possible lord howe courteously accompanied the american gentlemen the barge and they were rowed over the new jersey shore the report they made congress they stated that the commission lord howe only conferred upon

merchants then returned with their property into the harbor captain wickes soon united with him the lexington fourteen guns and cutter the dolphin ten guns with this little fleet the hero sailed completely around ireland capturing destroying sixteen prizes the british were astounded this audacity merchants and under writers were quite terror stricken they had never dreamed that the despised

received them with extreme courtesy and the queen marie antoinette was marked her attentions franklin the british ambassador lord stormont was enraged that regardless all the claims courtesy immediately returned england without even taking leave the king who can describe the exultation the rapture the tears with which these tidings were received the patriots america the may george washington drew his little band valley forge announce the great event and offer god prayers and thanksgivings the tone the english was immediately changed they abandoned threats and tried the effect entreaties several emissaries from the government approached franklin all bearing substance the same message they said cannot endure the thought that our beloved colonists should enter into alliance with our hereditary natural enemy france can you who are protestants consent unite with nation roman catholics you will remain firm your adhesion england will grant you all you ever wished for and even more but not forsake your mother country swell the pride and power perfidious france but all these efforts were unavailing the colonists began despise england they had wish for war with their unnatural parent and they knew that their independence was assured and that efforts which england could possibly make could now prevent all alike felt disposed spurn the bribes which england lavishly offered very extraordinary letter was sent franklin which was signed charles wissenstein franklin who was accustomed sifting evidence became satisfied that the message came from king george iii himself the letter declared that the perfidious french would certainly deceive the americans with false promises and defraud them after making the most liberal offers popular rights the americans would continue remain colonists under the british crown the document presented the following extraordinary promise those american patriots whom england had denounced traitors and doomed hung was deemed bribe which human virtue could not resist unreasonable that their the american patriots services their country should deprive them those advantages which their talents would otherwise have gained them the following persons shall have offices pensions for life their option namely franklin washington adams hancock etc case his majesty his successors should ever create american peers then those persons their descendants shall among the first created they choose franklin after conference with his colleagues replied the letter his soul was all fire with the insults our country had received and the wrongs she had endured wrote personally addressing the king can only give the concluding paragraph after stating that the independence america was secured that all attempts england prevent would impotent and that consequently was quite matter indifference the americans whether england acknowledged not wrote this proposition delivering ourselves bound and gagged ready for hanging without even right complain and without friend found afterward among all mankind you would have embrace upon the faith act parliament good god act your parliament this demonstrates that you not yet

irresistible this offer corrupt sir with your credential and convinces that you are not private volunteer your application bears the stamp british court character even the signature your king but think for moment what light must viewed america places you mean places among for you take care special article secure your own yourselves must then pay the salaries order enrich ourselves with those places but you will give pensions probably paid too out your expected american revenue and which none can accept without deserving and perhaps obtaining suspension peerages alas our long observation the vast servile majority your peers voting constantly for every measure proposed minister however weak wicked leaves small respect for that title consider sort tar and feather honor mixture foulness and folly which every man among who should accept from your king would obliged renounce exchange for that confessed the mobs their own country wear with everlasting infamy footnote reference the promises contained the letter franklin referred book which was said george iii had carefully studied called arcana imperii prince appease revolt had promised indemnity the revolters the question was

that not barn orchard hen roost was robbed john adams was sent join franklin aid him framing terms peace whenever england should disposed make such advances was man great abilities irreproachable integrity but had inherited from his english ancestry not only repulsive brusqueness but also prejudice against the french which nothing could remove his want courtesy his unconcealed assumption that france was acting out unmitigated selfishness and that consequently the americans owed the french debt gratitude often caused franklin much embarrassment this blunt man one time wrote uncourteous not

engaged public service for fifty years wrote congress begging permission retire from his responsible office congress could not spare his services they gave him additional appointment was commissioned unite with adams and jay those negotiations for peace which was evident must soon take place franklin loved the french could smile their foibles dressing their hair that they could not wear hat but were compelled carry under their arms also filling their noses with tobacco these said are mere follies there nothing wanting the character frenchman that belongs that agreeable and worthy man may perhaps mentioned defect the character franklin that when france could see nothing but the beautiful his eye was turned from every revolting spectacle the society elegantly dressed highly educated refined french ladies dinner parties glittering with gold and silver plate social intercourse with men whose philosophical attainments were the highest order and whose politeness speech and bearing rendered them delightful companions franklin found his time and thoughts engrossed all his voluminous writings find allusion those tremendous wrongs which louis xiv and louis had entailed upon the people wrongs which soon convulsed society with the volcanic throes the french revolution jefferson who succeeded franklin was cast different mould saw and fully comprehended the misery under which the millions the french peasantry were groaning and this led him the conviction that people could safe unless the government were placed their own hands still franklin like his brother deists hume and voltaire seeing how impotent were all the motives they could urge make man virtuous became thoroughly disgusted with human nature even went beyond paul his description the hopeless depravity man the idea reclaiming him his philosophy was abandoned entirely and yet was not prepared embrace that gospel which the experience ages has proved the wisdom god and the power god unto salvation enlarges writes parton upon this theme his most delightful manner another letter priestley this letter says his usual jocular strain that the more studies the moral part nature the more disgusted that finds men very badly constructed that they are more prone evil than good that they take great pleasure killing one another and that doubts whether the species worth preserving intimates that every attempt save their souls idle amusement you grow older writes you may perhaps repent having murdered mephitic air many honest harmless mice and wish that prevent mischief you had used boys and girls instead them this singular letter represents young angel having been sent this world under the guidance old courier spirit they arrive over the seas martinico the midst the horrible fight between the fleets rodney and grasse when writes through the clouds smoke the young angel saw the fire the guns the decks covered with mangled limbs and bodies dead dying the ships sinking burning blown into the air and the quantity pain misery and destruction the crews yet alive were with much eagerness dealing round one another turned angrily his guide and said you blundering blockhead you are ignorant your business you undertook conduct the earth and you have brought into hell sir said the guide have made such mistake this really the earth and these are men devils never treat one another this cruel manner they have more sense and more what men vainly call humanity was after the study human nature under the most favorable possible circumstances for more than three quarters century that this philosopher wrote these terrible comments upon our fallen race the latter part october lord cornwallis surrendered his whole army over seven thousand men yorktown the french fleet cut off his escape sea seven thousand french soldiers united with five thousand american troops prevented any retreat land the americans had thus captured two british armies was vain for england think sending third the conflict was virtually decided the prime minister lord north said received the tidings would have taken ball his breast threw his arms apart paced wildly and down the room exclaiming from time time god all over all england now was clamoring against the war thousands persons had perished the campaigns and financial embarrassments had come nearly all her institutions industry the english government made vigorous endeavors offering great bribes induce the american envoys paris abandon their french allies and make separate peace franklin wrote hartley through whom received these proposals believe there not man america few english tories excepted that would not spurn the thought deserting noble and generous friend for the sake truce with unjust and cruel enemy british diplomacy tried all its arts intrigue separate america from france the negotiations for peace but all vain the british minister grenville interview with franklin ridiculed the idea that america owed france any gratitude urging that france sought only her own selfish interests told him franklin writes that was strongly impressed with the kind assistance afforded france our distress and the generous and noble manner which was granted without exacting stipulating for single privilege particular advantage herself our commerce otherwise that could never suffer myself think such reasonings for lessening the obligation the february general conway one the leaders the opposition the same who had moved the repeal the stamp act seventeen years before presented resolution the house commons that the reduction the colonies force arms impracticable violent even fierce debate ensued which was continued until one clock the morning then the cry question became general the vote was carried majority nineteen this terminated the american war the people england had decided against acclamations writes wraxall pierced the roof and might have been heard westminster hall this great victory was followed another resolve was address george iii soliciting him stop the prosecution any further hostilities against the revolted colonies for the purpose reducing them obedience force notwithstanding the lateness the hour these votes were immediately communicated the king who was pitiable condition aged nearly blind half crazed and stubborn even insanity his determination subjugate the americans the poor old man his rage threatened abandon england renounce the crown and cloister himself his estate hanover was however compelled yield dismiss his tory ministers and accept whig cabinet edmund burke wrote warm congratulatory letter franklin footnote edmund burke wrote franklin that the motion was the declaration two hundred and thirty four members but was the opinion thought the whole house and now the final struggle arose respecting the terms peace the three great questions discussed diplomatic arrangements were gradually and very cautiously entered into were what shall the boundaries the united states shall the americans allowed fish the great banks what provision shall made for the tories america whose estates have been confiscated there were many preliminary meetings private semi official and official there was general impression that franklin was the man whose opinion would entirely control that his countrymen was approached every way and the utmost endeavors were made induce the american commissioners enter into private treaty without consulting the french ministry full account the diplomatic conflict which ensued would fill volume one occasion the british minister grenville said case england grants america independence the french minister vergennes smiled and said america has already won her independence she does not ask you there franklin will answer you that point sure franklin said not consider necessary bargain for that which our own have bought our independence the expense much blood and treasure and are full possession many these preliminary interviews took place paris the amount money and blood which the pugnacious government england had expended totally needless wars can not computed the misery with which those wars had deluged this unhappy globe god only can comprehend richard oswald retired london merchant vast wealth was sent lord shelburne prime minister confidential messenger sound franklin was frank the extreme peace said absolutely necessary for england the nation has been foolishly involved four wars and can longer raise money carry them continued will absolutely necessary stop the payment interest money the public debt adams and jay were soon associated with franklin these negotiations jay was entire sympathy with adams his antipathy the french they both assumed that france was meanly seeking only her own interests making use america simply instrument for the accomplishment her selfish purposes footnote adams wrote his diary november jay don like any frenchman the marquis fayette clever but frenchman jared sparks after carefully examining the office foreign affairs london the correspondence the french ministers with the american envoys during the whole war writes after examining the subject with all the care and accuracy which these means information have enabled give prepared express belief most fully that jay was mistaken both regard the aims the french court and the plans pursued them gain their supposed ends footnote diplomatic correspondence the american revolution viii jay was insanely suspicious the french that was afraid that the french ministry would send spies pick the locks his lodgings and steal his important papers therefore always carried them about his person also believed that count vergennes had actually proposed the british minister that they should unite their armies seize the united states and divide america between them such were the colleagues united with franklin the negotiations for peace required all his consummate wisdom able guide affairs wisely under such difficult circumstances may doubted whether there was another man america who could have surmounted the obstacles over which triumphed both franklin colleagues regarded him with suspicion they believed that had been won over such sympathy with the french that would willing sacrifice the interests his own country please them they wrote letters home severely denouncing him and they seemed stand more fear france than england franklin wrote adams very staunch against the tories more decided great deal upon that point than jay myself the british ministers insisted that the confiscated estates the american tories should restored them and all their losses reimbursed franklin silenced the demand drawing from his pocket the following articles which proposed should added the treaty agreed that his britannic majesty will earnestly recommend his parliament provide for and make compensation the merchants and shop keepers boston whose goods and merchandise were seized and taken out their stores ware houses and shops order general gage and others his commanding officers there and also the inhabitants philadelphia for the goods taken away his army there and make compensation also for the tobacco rice indigo and negroes seized and carried off his armies under generals arnold cornwallis and others from the states virginia north and south carolina and georgia and for all the vessels and cargoes belonging the inhabitants the said united states which were stopped seized taken either the ports the seas his governors his ships war before the declaration war against the united states and further agreed that his britannic majesty will also earnestly recommend his parliament make compensation for all the towns villages and farms burnt and destroyed his troops adherents these united states the three british commissioners were confounded these counter demands and said not another word about reimbursing the american tories the november the preliminaries were signed subject the assent the french ministers who were also submit their preliminaries the american envoys these articles the boundaries were established the americans could fish the banks newfoundland and cure their fish the unsettled shores nova scotia and labrador congress was recommend the several states restore the confiscated property real british subjects private debts were paid there were more confiscations prosecutions either side for acts during the war the british troops were withdrawn the navigation the mississippi was declared free and any place captured after the signing these articles was restored the january count vergennes and the british minister fitzherbert signed their preliminaries the presence franklin and adams not till then did the english order hostilities suspended and declare the senseless war end there was universal satisfaction america with the exception the king and few his ministers there was general satisfaction england true that the national pride was sorely humiliated but after all these woes which england had inflicted upon america her own statesmen with almost undivided voice declared that the interests both nations were alike promoted having few feeble colonies elevated into the rich and flourishing republic the united states thus the war the american revolution must pronounced have been the part england which forced one the most disastrous and senseless those blunders which have ever accompanied the progress our race footnote contemplate the still greater blunder our civil war was forced upon the nation the slave traders that they might perpetuate slavery and now after the infliction woes which finite imagination can gauge these very slave holders declare with one voice that nothing would induce them reinstate the execrable institution how much misery would have been averted and what comparative paradise would our southern country now have been before instead after the war the oppressed had been allowed free chapter life closing scenes advice thomas paine scenes passy journey the coast return america elected governor pennsylvania attends the constitutional convention proposes prayers remarkable speech letter stiles christ the cross last sickness and death about this time some one knowing franklin deistical views presented for his opinion treatise denouncing the idea that there was any god who manifested any interest the affairs men that there was any particular providence though franklin did not accept the idea that jesus christ was divine messenger and that the bible was supernatural revelation god will certainly did not his latter years deny that there was god who superintended the affairs this world and whom was proper worship generally supposed that thomas paine was the author this treatise and that was portion his age reason franklin his memorable reply wrote have read your manuscript with some attention the argument contains against particular providence though you allow general providence you strike the foundations all religion for without the belief providence that takes cognizance guards and guides and may favor particular persons there motive worship deity fear

yourself great deal mortification the enemies may raise against you and perhaps good deal regret and repentance men are wicked with religion what would they without franklin testifies the remarkable courtesy which characterized all the movements the french minister during these protracted and delicate negotiations the definitive treaty was signed the september was unanimously ratified congress the january the king england gave his signature the april thus two years and three months passed between the beginning negotiations and the conclusion the treaty peace the termination the war crowds englishmen flocked paris franklin was then recognized incomparably the most illustrious man the continent europe his apartments were ever thronged with men highest note from all the nations was then seventy eight years age suffering severely from the gout and the gravel often received his guests his bed chamber sitting his night gown wrapped flannels and reclining pillow yet his mind retained all its brilliance all who saw him were charmed baynes wrote all the celebrated persons whom life have chanced see franklin both from his appearance and his conversation seemed the most remarkable his venerable patriarchal appearance the simplicity his manner and language and the novelty his observations impressed one the most extraordinary men that ever existed this time wrote several essays which are esteemed among the best his writings was awaiting permission from congress return america his son the governor who was receiving pension eight hundred pounds from the british government came over from england his illustrious father soliciting reconciliation this was after the separation many years franklin responded kindly though said that nothing had ever wounded him keenly find himself deserted his old age his only son and see him taking arms against cause upon which had staked life fortune and honor year passed before franklin was recalled was then feeble that could not walk and could only ride litter jefferson succeeded him upon his arrival paris the count vergennes said you replace franklin understand jefferson replied succeed him man can replace him franklin infirmities were such that could not call upon the king the minister for audience leave however wrote count vergennes very grateful and affectionate letter which said may beg the favor you sir express respectfully for his majesty the deep sense have all the inestimable benefits his goodness has conferred country sentiment that will the business the little remainder the life now left impress equally the minds all countrymen sincere prayers are that god may shower down his blessings the king the queen their children and all the royal family the latest generations the reply was equally cordial and affectionate parting gift the king sent franklin his portrait decorated with four hundred and eight diamonds its estimated value was ten thousand dollars the july franklin accompanied many admiring friends carriages commenced his slow journey litter from passy havre was four clock the afternoon the litter was borne two mules the first night they stopped germain thence the journey was continued the rate about eighteen miles day the motion the litter did not seriously incommode him the cardinal rochefoucald archbishop rouen insisted upon his accepting the hospitality his mansion gaillon was superb chateau commanding magnificent prospect with galleries crowded with paintings and the most valuable works art the cardinal writes franklin much respected and beloved the people this country bearing all respects most excellent character though entreated prolong his visit franklin resumed his journey early hour the next morning rouen was again received with the most flattering attentions the elite the city gave very brilliant supper his honor thus journeying truly triumphant march franklin reached havre the july after delay three days crossed the channel southampton his old friends came crowds and from great distances see him even the british government had the courtesy send order exempting his effects from custom house duties will remembered that franklin was remarkable swimmer there are some human bodies much more buoyant than others records the singular fact that taking warm salt water bath here fell asleep floating his back and did not awake for hour this writes thing which never did before and would hardly have thought possible the july the ship spread her sails the voyage lasted seven weeks this extraordinary man then seventy nine years age wrote the passage three essays which are estimated among the most useful and able any which emanated from his pen the september the ship entered delaware bay and the next morning cast anchor opposite philadelphia wrote son law came with boat for landed market street wharf where were received crowd people with huzzahs and accompanied with acclamations quite door found family well god praised and thanked for all his mercies the assembly was session and immediately voted him congratulatory address washington also wrote him letter cordial welcome the long sea voyage proved very beneficial his health was immediately elected the supreme executive and was chosen chairman that body evident that was gratified this token popular regard wrote friend had not firmness enough resist the unanimous desire country folk and find myself harnessed again their service for another year they engrossed the prime life they have eaten flesh and seem resolved now pick bones soon after was elected president should now say governor pennsylvania the vote rested with the executive council and the assembly seventy seven all received seventy six votes notwithstanding the ravages war peace came with her usual blessings her hand the tory journals england were presenting deplorable views the ruin the country since deprived the beneficial government the british cabinet franklin wrote his old friend david hartley your newspapers are filled with accounts distresses and miseries that these states are plunged into since their separation from britain you may believe when tell you that there truth those accounts find all property land and houses augmented vastly value that houses town least four fold the crops have been plentiful and yet the produce sells high the great profit the farmer working people have plenty employ and high pay for their labor there were many imperfections attending the old confederacy the year convention met philadelphia frame new constitution there was strong opposition this movement washington and franklin were both delegates washington took the chair the good nature and wisdom franklin ruled the house the convention met the state house franklin eighty one years age was regularly his seat five hours day for four months was thoroughly democratic his views and opposed every measure which had any tendency extend aristocratic privilege had seen that the british government was the hands the nobles and silent prudence rendered necessary for him reference the arbitrary government france could not but see that the peasantry were subject the most intolerable abuses this led him detest monarchy and every thing his power place the government this country the hands the people much time was occupied deciding upon the terms union between the smaller and the larger states will remembered that this was the subject very excited debates the convention the discussion was earnest often acrimonious such bitterness feeling was engendered that for some time was feared that union could effected evident that franklin approached the grave became more devout and that lost all confidence the powers philosophical speculations reform regenerate fallen man saw that the interposition divine power was needed allay the intense excitement the convention and lead the impassioned members act under the conviction that they were responsible god the june this venerable patriarchal man offered the following memorable resolve resolved that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance heaven and its blessings our deliberations held the assembly every morning before proceed business and that one more the clergy this city requested officiate that service the speech which accompanied this motion will forever conspicuous our annals said president the small progress have made after four five weeks close attendence and continual reasonings with each other our different sentiments almost every question methinks melancholy proof the imperfection the human understanding this situation this assembly groping were the dark find political truth and scarce able distinguish when presented how has happened sir that have not yet hitherto once thought humbly applying the father lights illuminate our understandings the beginning the contest with britain when were sensible danger had daily prayers this room for divine protection our prayers sir were heard and they were graciously answered all who were engaged the struggle must have observed frequent instances superintending providence our favor that kind providence owe this happy opportunity consulting peace the means establishing our future national felicity and have now forgotten that powerful friend imagine that longer need his assistance have lived sir long time and the longer live the more convincing proofs see this truth that god governs the affairs men and sparrow cannot fall the ground without his notice probable that empire can rise without his aid have been assured sir the sacred writings that except the lord build the house they labor vain that build firmly believe this and also believe that without his concurring aid shall succeed this political building better than the building babel almost incomprehensible that under the influence such appeal the great majority the assembly should have voted against seeking divine aid note appended this speech franklin writes the convention except three four persons thought prayers unnecessary footnote parton undoubtedly suggested the true reason for this strange refusal seek divine guidance writes think not improbable that the cause this opposition proposal seldom negatived the united states was the prevalence the convention the french tone feeling with regard religious observances was the more remarkable see the aged franklin who was deist fifteen and had just returned from france coming back the sentiments his ancestors parton franklin vol the convention came triumphant close early september behind the speaker chair there was picture the rising sun while the members were signing franklin turned madison and said have often the course the session and the vicissitudes hopes and fears its issue looked the picture behind the president without being able tell whether the sun were rising setting but now length have the happiness know that rising not setting sun washington was universally revered franklin was both revered and loved was almost the universal feeling that next washington our nation was indebted franklin for its independence franklin occupied the arduous field diplomacy the position which washington occupied the head our armies was certain that franklin had one period his life entirely renounced his belief christianity divine revelation his christian friends numbering hundreds encouraged some the utterances his old age were anxious know had returned the faith his fathers ezra stiles president yale college was friend franklin many years standing when the revered patriot had reached his eighty fifth year stiles wrote soliciting his portrait for the college library this letter says wish know the opinion venerable friend concerning jesus nazareth will not impute this impertinence improper curiosity one who for many years has continued love esteem and reverence his abilities and literary character with ardor and affection bordering adoration what stiles and the community general wished know was whether franklin recognized the divine supernatural origin christianity franklin evaded the question this evasion course indicates that did not recognize the religion jesus the authority thus saith the lord but wished avoid wounding the feelings his christian friends this avowal wrote this creed believe god the creator the universe that governs his providence that ought worshiped that the most acceptable service render him doing good his other children that the soul man immortal and will treated with justice another life respecting its conduct this these take fundamental points all sound religion and regard them you whatever sect meet with them jesus nazareth opinion whom you particularly desire think his system morals and his religion left them the best the world ever saw like see but apprehend has received various corrupting changes and have with most the dissenters england some doubts his divinity though question not dogmatize upon having never studied and think needless busy myself with now when expect soon opportunity knowing the truth with less trouble see however harm its being believed that belief has the good consequence probably has making his doctrines more respected and observed especially not perceive that the supreme takes amiss distinguishing the unbelievers his government this world with any peculiar marks his displeasure shall only add respecting myself that having experienced the goodness that being conducting prosperously through long life have doubt its continuance the next though without the smallest conceit meriting such goodness then adds the following suggestive postscript confide that you will not expose criticism and censures publishing any part this communication you have ever let others enjoy their religious sentiments without reflecting them for those that appeared unsupportable even absurd all sects here and have great variety have experienced good will assisting them with subscriptions for the building their new places worship and have never opposed any their doctrines hope out the world peace with them all much his time these hours sickness employed writing his autobiography the sufferings endured were times very severe but when spoke his approaching departure was with composure one time when his daughter expressed the wish that might yet live many years replied hope not clerical friend visited him just one his paroxysms pain came his friend consequence was about retire said don away these pains will soon over they are for good and besides what are the pains moment comparison with the pleasures eternity there was one the chambers his house very beautiful painting christ the cross requested his nurse very worthy woman the friends persuasion bring down and place directly before him the rev david ritter great admirer franklin called see him had however but few moments before breathed his last sarah humphries the nurse invited david into the chamber view the remains ritter expressed surprise seeing the picture the saviour the cross occupying conspicuous position saying you know sarah that many people think that franklin was not after this sort yes she replied but thee knows david that many make great fuss about religion who have very little and many who say but little have good deal was never satisfied day passed away unless had done some one service benjamin franklin was one that sort will tell thee how the picture came here many weeks ago lay beckoned him and told this picture stairs and begged would bring him brought his face brightened looked and said sarah there picture worth looking that the picture him who came into the world teach men love one another after looking wistfully for some time said sarah set this picture over the mantel piece right before lie like look when fixed looked very much and indeed died with his eyes fixed upon footnote this reminds the exclamation the emperor titus who the close day which could not perceive that had done any good exclaimed sadly perdidi diem have lost day beautifully has the sentiment been expressed the words which would well for all treasure count that day lost whose low descending sun views thy hand worthy action done however deeply franklin these dying hours may have pondered the sublimities immortality the resurrection the judgment throne the final verdict heaven hell was very reticent respecting those themes certainly see none the triumph paul and thousands others who have varied language expressed the sentiment that jesus can make dying bed feel soft downy pillows are few hours before his death some one urged him change his position that might breathe easier replied dying man can nothing easy these were his last words then sank into lethargy from which passed into that sleep which has earthly waking was eleven clock night april had lived eighty four years three months and eleven days but candid and charitable reader can peruse this narrative without the admission that benjamin franklin notwithstanding his imperfections was one the wisest and best all the fallen children adam from his dying hour the present day his memory has been justly cherished with reverence and affection throughout the civilized world and there fear that this verdict will ever reversed transcriber note minor changes have been made correct obvious typesetters errors otherwise every effort has been made remain true the author
